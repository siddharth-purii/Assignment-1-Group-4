Albert was the first European ruler to establish Protestantism as the official state religion of his lands . He proved instrumental in the political spread of Protestantism in its early stage , ruling the Prussian lands for nearly six decades ( 15101568 ) . A member of the Brandenburg-Ansbach branch of the House of Hohenzollern , Albert 's election as Grand Master had brought about hopes of a reversal of the declining fortune of the Teutonic Knights . He was a skilled political administrator and leader , and did indeed reverse the decline of the Teutonic Order .

Albert 's rule in Prussia was fairly prosperous . Although he had some trouble with the peasantry , the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the Catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established Prussian court . He was active in imperial politics , joining the League of Torgau in 1526 , and acted in unison with the Protestants in plotting to overthrow Emperor Charles V after the issue of the Augsburg Interim in May 1548 . Albert established schools in every town and founded Knigsberg University in 1544 . He promoted culture and arts , patronising the works of Erasmus Reinhold and Caspar Hennenberger . Albert 's final years were clouded by peasant resentment of heavy taxes , a step he felt compelled to take due to there no longer being any church land available to confiscate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Paul Skali also caused various religious and political disputes . Albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power , and died at Tapiau on 20 March 1568 . His son Albert Frederick succeeded him as Duke of Prussia . Albert 's dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia , paving the way for the rise of the House of Hohenzollern . He is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation , and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of Germany . # Early life # Albert was born in Ansbach in Franconia as the third son of Frederick I , Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach . His mother was Sophia , daughter of Casimir IV Jagiellon , Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland , and his wife Elisabeth of Austria . He was raised for a career in the Church and spent some time at the court of Hermann IV of Hesse , Elector of Cologne , who appointed him canon of the Cologne Cathedral .

His career was forwarded by the Church however and institutions of the Catholic clerics supported his early advance . Turning to a more active life , Albert accompanied Emperor Maximilian I to Italy in 1508 , and after his return spent some time in the Kingdom of Hungary . # Grand Master # Duke Frederick of Saxony , Grand Master of the Teutonic Order , died in December 1510 . Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle , Sigismund I the Old , Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland , would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern Prussia , which had been held by the Order under Polish suzerainty since the Second Peace of Thorn ( 1466 ) . The new Grand Master , aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy , refused to submit to the crown of Poland . As war over the Order 's existence appeared inevitable , Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ravages of members of the Order in Poland , culminated in a war which began in December 1519 and devastated Prussia . Albert was granted a four-year truce early in 1521 . The dispute was referred to Emperor Charles V and other princes , but as no settlement was reached Albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war . For this purpose he visited the Diet of Nuremberg in 1522 , where he made the acquaintance of the Reformer Andreas Osiander , by whose influence Albert was won over to Protestantism . The Grand Master then journeyed to Wittenberg , where he was advised by Martin Luther to abandon the rules of his Order , to marry , and to convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself . This proposal , which was understandably appealing to Albert , had already been discussed by some of his relatives ; but it was necessary to proceed cautiously , and he assured Pope Adrian VI that he was anxious to reform the Order and punish the knights who had adopted Lutheran doctrines . Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the Prussians , while Albert 's brother , Margrave George of Brandenburg-Ansbach , laid the scheme before their uncle , Sigismund I the Old of Poland . # Duke in Prussia # After some delay Sigismund assented to the offer , with the provision that Prussia should be treated as a Polish fiefdom ; and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at Krakw , Albert pledged a personal oath to Sigismund I and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 February 1525 . The Estates of the land then met at Knigsberg ( Kaliningrad ) and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke , who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of Luther . This transition did not , however , take place without protest . Summoned before the imperial court of justice , Albert refused to appear and was proscribed , while the Order elected a new Grand Master , Walter von Cronberg , who received Prussia as a fief at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing the tumult of the Reformation , the German Peasants ' War , and the wars against the Ottoman Turks , they did not enforce the ban on the duke , and agitation against him soon died away . In imperial politics Albert was fairly active . Joining the League of Torgau in 1526 , he acted in unison with the Protestants , and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow Charles V after the issue of the Augsburg Interim in May 1548 . For various reasons , however , poverty and personal inclination among others , he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period . The early years of Albert 's rule in Prussia were fairly prosperous . Although he had some trouble with the peasantry , the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court . He did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life .

Albert also paid for the printing of the Astronomical Prutenic Tables compiled by Erasmus Reinhold and the first maps of Prussia by Caspar Hennenberger . This step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of Albert 's reign . Osiander 's divergence from Luther 's doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with Philip Melanchthon , who had adherents in Knigsberg , and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town . The duke strenuously supported Osiander , and the area of the quarrel soon broadened . There were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles , the burden of taxation was heavy , and Albert 's rule became unpopular . After Osiander 's death in 1552 , Albert favoured a preacher named Johann Funck , who , with an adventurer named Paul Skali , exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense . The state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should that happen , to appoint a regent , as his only son , Albert Frederick was still a mere youth . The duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of Osiander , and the climax came in 1566 when the Estates appealed to King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland , Albert 's cousin , who sent a commission to Knigsberg . Skali saved his life by flight , but Funck was executed . The question of the regency was settled , and a form of Lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers . Virtually deprived of power , the duke lived for two more years , and died at Tapiau on 20 March 1568 . Cornelis Floris de Vriendt designed his tomb within Knigsberg Cathedral . Albert was a voluminous letter writer , and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time . # Legacy # Although Albert has received relatively little recognition in German history , his dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia , which would eventually become arguably the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Albert is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation , and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of Germany . He was a skilled political administrator and leader , and effectively reversed the decline of the Teutonic Order , until he betrayed it by transforming the order 's lands into his own duchy , secularizing it in the process . Albert was the first German noble to support Luther 's ideas and in 1544 founded the University of Knigsberg , the Albertina , as a rival to the Roman Catholic Cracow Academy . It was the second Lutheran university in the German states , after the University of Marburg . A relief of Albert over the Renaissance-era portal of Knigsberg Castle 's southern wing was created by Andreas Hess in 1551 according to plans by Christoph Rmer . Another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the Albertina 's original campus .

Albert Wolff also designed an equestrian statue of Albert located at the new campus of the Albertina . King 's Gate contains a statue of Albert . Albert was oft-honored in the quarter Maraunenhof in northern Knigsberg . Its main street was named Herzog-Albrecht-Allee in 1906 .

@@4514 Genetically modified maize ( corn ) is a genetically modified crop . Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits , including resistance to pests and to herbicides . Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries . GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects , impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow . One strain , called Starlink , was approved only for animal feed in the US , but was found in food , leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000. # Marketed Products # # Herbicide resistant maize # Corn varieties resistant to glyphosate herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by Monsanto , and are known as Roundup Ready Corn . They tolerate the use of Roundup . Bayer CropScience developed Liberty Link Corn that is resistant to glufosinate .

As of 2011 , herbicide-resistant GM corn was grown in 14 countries . By 2012 , 26 varieties herbicide-resistant GM maize were authorised for import into the European Union . In 2012 the EU was reported to import 30 million tons a year of GM crops , but such imports remain controversial . Cultivation of herbicide-resistant corn in the EU provides substantial farm-level benefits . # Insecticide-producing corn # Bt corn is a variant of maize that has been genetically altered to express one or more proteins from the Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria . The protein is poisonous to certain insect pests and is widely used in organic gardening . The European corn borer causes about a billion dollars in damage to corn crops each year . In recent years , traits have been added to ward off Corn ear worms and root worms , the latter of which annually causes about a billion dollars in damages .

The insect stops eating within a few hours and eventually starves . In 1996 , the first GM maize producing a Bt Cry protein was approved , which killed the European corn borer and related species ; subsequent Bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae . Bt genes that are approved include the following , singly and stacked ( event name between brackets ) : Cry1A.105 ( MON89034 ) , CryIAb ( MON810 ) , CryIF ( 1507 ) , Cry2Ab ( MON89034 ) , Cry3Bb1 ( MON863 and MON88017 ) , Cry34Ab1 ( 59122 ) , Cry35Ab1 ( 59122 ) , mCry3A ( MIR604 ) , and Vip3A ( MIR162 ) , in both corn and cotton .

The theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide .

The scientific rigor of the studies regarding human health has been disputed due to alleged lack of independence and due to conflicts of interest involving governing bodies and some of those who perform and evaluate the studies . GM crops provide a number of ecological benefits , but there are also concerns for their overuse , stalled research outside of the Bt seed industry , proper management and issues with Bt resistance arising from their misuse . Critics have objected to GM crops on ecological , economic and health grounds . The economic issues derive from those organisms that are subject to intellectual property law , mostly patents .

Prior to the enactment of the Local Government ( Dublin ) Act 1993 , the county was a unified whole even though it was administered by two local authorities - Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation . Since the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001 in particular , the geographic area of the county has been divided between three entities at the level of county and a further entity at the level of city . They rank equally as first level local administrative units of the NUTS 3 Dublin Region for Eurostat purposes . There are 34 LAU 1 entities in the Republic of Ireland .

The area lost its administrative county status in 1994 , with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ' ' Local Government ( Dublin ) Act , 1993 ' ' stating that the county shall cease to exist .

Despite the legal status of the Dublin Region , the term County Dublin is still in common usage . Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a County Dublin or Dublin Region basis . The area formerly known as County Dublin is now defined in legislation solely as the Dublin Region under the ' ' Local Government Act , 1991 ( Regional Authorities ) ( Establishment ) Order , 1993 ' ' , and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area .

This resulted in the economy of the county expanding by almost 100% between the early 1990s and 2007 . This growth resulted from incoming high-value industries , such as financial services and software manufacturing , as well as low-skilled retail and domestic services , which caused a shift away from older manufacturing-industry .

@@9514 Edvard Hagerup Grieg ( ; 15 June 1843 4 September 1907 ) was a Norwegian composer and pianist . He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers , and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide . His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum , as well as helping develop a national identity , much as Jean Sibelius and Antonn Dvok did in Finland and Bohemia respectively . # Biography # Edvard Hagerup Grieg was born in Bergen , Norway , on 15 June 1843 . His parents were Alexander Grieg ( 18061875 ) , a merchant and vice-consul in Bergen ; and Gesine Judithe Hagerup ( 18141875 ) , a music teacher and daughter of Edvard Hagerup . The family name , originally spelled Greig , has Scottish origins . After the Battle of Culloden in 1746 , Grieg 's great-grandfather , Alexander Greig , traveled widely , settling in Norway about 1770 , and establishing business interests in Bergen .

Grieg studied in several schools , including Tanks Upper School , Tanks School and the N.P.S , Norwegian Private School . In the summer of 1858 , Grieg met the eminent Norwegian violinist Ole Bull , who was a family friend ; Bull 's brother was married to Grieg 's aunt . Bull recognized the 15-year-old boy 's talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the Leipzig Conservatory , the piano department of which was directed by Ignaz Moscheles . Grieg enrolled in the conservatory , concentrating on the piano , and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in Leipzig . He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study . An exception was the organ , which was mandatory for piano students . In the spring of 1860 , he survived a life-threatening lung disease , pleurisy and tuberculosis . Throughout his life , Grieg 's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine . He suffered from numerous respiratory infections , and ultimately developed combined lung and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanatoria both in Norway and abroad . Several of his doctors became his personal friends . In 1861 , Grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in Karlshamn , Sweden . In 1862 , he finished his studies in Leipzig and held his first concert in his home town , where his programme included Beethoven 's ' ' Pathtique ' ' sonata . In 1863 , Grieg went to Copenhagen , Denmark , and stayed there for three years . He met the Danish composers J. P. E. Hartmann and Niels Gade . He also met his fellow Norwegian composer Rikard Nordraak ( composer of the Norwegian national anthem ) , who became a good friend and source of inspiration . Nordraak died in 1866 , and Grieg composed a funeral march in his honor . On 11 June 1867 , Grieg married his first cousin , Nina Hagerup . The next year , their only child , Alexandra , was born . Alexandra died in 1869 from meningitis . In the summer of 1868 , Grieg wrote his Piano Concerto in A minor while on holiday in Denmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 April 1869 in the Casino Theater in Copenhagen . Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in Christiania ( as Oslo was then named ) . In 1868 , Franz Liszt , who had not yet met Grieg , wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education , which led to Grieg 's obtaining a travel grant . The two men met in Rome in 1870 . On Grieg 's first visit , they went over Grieg 's Violin Sonata No. 1 , which pleased Liszt greatly . On his second visit , in April , Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto , which Liszt proceeded to sightread ( including the orchestral arrangement ) . Liszt 's rendition greatly impressed his audience , although Grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly . Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on orchestration , ( for example , to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet ) .

Grieg was struck by the sadness in Tchaikovsky. cite web Grieg was awarded two honorary doctorates , first by Cambridge University in 1894 and the next from Oxford University in 1906. # Later years # The Norwegian government provided him with a pension . In the spring 1903 , Grieg made nine 78-rpm gramophone recordings of his piano music in Paris ; all of these historic discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs , despite limited fidelity . Grieg also made live-recording player piano music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and Welte-Mignon reproducing system , all of which survive today and can be heard .

He is a genius that we Scandinavians can not do other than love . Edvard Grieg died in the late summer of 1907 , aged 64 , after a long period of illness . His final words were Well , if it must be so . The funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people out on the streets of his home town to honor him . Following his wish , his own ' ' Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak ' ' was played in an orchestration by his friend Johan Halvorsen , who had married Grieg 's niece .

Edvard Grieg and his wife considered themselves Unitarians and Nina went to the Unitarian church in Copenhagen after his death . # Music # Some of Grieg 's early works include a symphony ( which he later suppressed ) and a piano sonata . He also wrote three violin sonatas and a cello sonata . Grieg also composed the incidental music for Henrik Ibsen 's play , Peer Gynt - which includes the famous excerpt entitled , In the Hall of the Mountain King . In this piece of music , the adventures of the anti-hero , Peer Gynt , are related , including the episode in which he steals a bride at her wedding . The angry guests chase him , and Peer falls , hitting his head on a rock . He wakes up in a mountain surrounded by trolls . The music of In the Hall of the Mountain King represents the angry trolls taunting Peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats . The music ends with Peer escaping from the mountain . In an 1874 letter to his friend Frants Beyer , Grieg expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the movement he composed for Peer Gynt , writing I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King something that I literally ca n't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies , exaggerated Norwegian nationalism , and trollish self-satisfaction ! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible . Grieg 's ' ' Holberg Suite ' ' was originally written for the piano , and later arranged by the composer for string orchestra . Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets Heinrich Heine , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Henrik Ibsen , Hans Christian Andersen , Rudyard Kipling and others . Russian composer Nikolai Myaskovsky used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet . Norwegian pianist Eva Knardahl recorded the composer 's complete piano music during 1978 and 1980 . The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs by BIS Records .

@@12514 In traditional belief and fiction , a ghost ( sometimes known as a spectre ( British English ) or specter ( American English ) , phantom , apparition or spook ) is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that can appear , in visible form or other manifestation , to the living . Descriptions of the apparition of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes , to realistic , lifelike visions . The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy , or in spiritism as a ' ' sance ' ' . The belief in manifestations of the spirits of the dead is widespread , dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures . Certain religious practicesfuneral rites , exorcisms , and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magicare specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead .

The synonym ' ' spook ' ' is a Dutch loanword , akin to Low German ' ' spk ' ' ( of uncertain etymology ) ; it entered the English language via the United States in the 19th century .

The term ' ' shade ' ' in classical mythology translates Greek , or Latin ' ' umbra ' ' , in reference to the notion of spirits in the Greek underworld .

An association with the verb ' ' writhe ' ' was the etymology favored by J. R. R. Tolkien .

Bogey or ' ' bogy/bogie ' ' is a term for a ghost , and appears in Scottish poet John Mayne 's ' ' Hallowe'en ' ' in 1780 . A ' ' revenant ' ' is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living , either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated ( undead ) corpse . Also related is the concept of a fetch , the visible ghost or spirit of a person yet alive . # Typology # # Anthropological context # A notion of the transcendent , supernatural or numinous , usually involving entities like ghosts , demons or deities , is a cultural universal .

Strategies for preventing revenants may either include sacrifice , i.e. , giving the dead food and drink to pacify them , or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return . Ritual feeding of the dead is performed in traditions like the Chinese Ghost Festival or the Western All Souls ' Day . Magical banishment of the dead is present in many of the world 's burial customs . The bodies found in many tumuli ( kurgan ) had been ritually bound before burial , and the custom of binding the dead persists , for example , in rural Anatolia . Nineteenth-century anthropologist James Frazer stated in his classic work , ' ' The Golden Bough ' ' , that souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body . # Ghosts and the afterlife # Although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal , it appears to have been widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body in every feature , even down to clothing the person wore .

This is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures , but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern ghost story , Gothic horror , and other horror fiction dealing with the supernatural . # Common attributes # Another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty , airy , or subtle material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person within the person ( the person 's spirit ) , most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person 's breath , which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist .

In the Bible , God is depicted as synthesising Adam , as a living soul , from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God . In many traditional accounts , ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance ( vengeful ghosts ) , or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life .

This theme has been used in literature in ' ' The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ' ' by Coleridge . # Locale # A place where ghosts are reported is described as haunted , and often seen as being inhabited by spirits of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property . Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building 's past such as murder , accidental death , or suicide sometimes in the recent or ancient past .

The 5th-century BC play ' ' Oresteia ' ' contains one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction . # #Roman Empire and Late Antiquity# # The ancient Romans believed a ghost could be used to exact revenge on an enemy by scratching a curse on a piece of lead or pottery and placing it into a grave . Plutarch , in the 1st century AD , described the haunting of the baths at Chaeronea by the ghost of a murdered man . The ghosts loud and frightful groans caused the people of the town to seal up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a haunted house from the ancient classical world is given by Pliny the Younger ( c. 50 AD ) . Pliny describes the haunting of a house in Athens by a ghost bound in chains . The hauntings ceased when the ghost 's shackled skeleton was unearthed , and given a proper reburial . The writers Plautus and Lucian also wrote stories about haunted houses . In the New Testament , Jesus has to persuade the Disciples that he is not a ghost following the resurrection , Luke 24:3739 ( some versions of the Bible , such as the KJV and NKJV , use the term spirit ) . In a similar vein , Jesus ' followers at first believe him to be a ghost ( spirit ) when they see him walking on water . One of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was Lucian of Samosata in the 2nd century AD . In his tale The Doubter ( circa 150 AD ) he relates how Democritus the learned man from Abdera in Thrace lived in a tomb outside the city gates to prove that cemeteries were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he persisted in his disbelief despite practical jokes perpetrated by some young men of Abdera who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him . This account by Lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look . In the 5th century AD , the Christian priest Constantius of Lyon recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living , and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied. # Middle Ages # Ghosts reported in medieval Europe tended to fall into two categories : the souls of the dead , or demons . The souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose . Demonic ghosts were those which existed only to torment or tempt the living . The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of Jesus Christ . The soul of a dead person would divulge their mission , while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the Holy Name . Most ghosts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to atone for their transgressions in life . Their penance was generally related to their sin . For example , the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue ; the ghost of another man , who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor , was condemned to wear the cloak , now heavy as a church tower . These ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering . Other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths . Medieval European ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the Victorian age , and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession . Some were less solid , and could move through walls . Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive , and dressed in tattered gray rags . The vast majority of reported sightings were male . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in the forest , or in the remains of an Iron Age hillfort , as at Wandlebury , near Cambridge , England . Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights , which vanished when defeated . From the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211 , at the time of the Albigensian Crusade . Gervase of Tilbury , Marshal of Arles , wrote that the image of Guilhem , a boy recently murdered in the forest , appeared in his cousin 's home in Beaucaire , near Avignon . This series of visits lasted all of the summer . Through his cousin , who spoke for him , the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished , until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly , leading to an extended disquisition on theology . The boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in Purgatory , and reported that God was most pleased with the ongoing Crusade against the Cathar heretics , launched three years earlier . The time of the Albigensian Crusade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy . Haunted houses are featured in the 9th-century ' ' Arabian Nights ' ' ( such as the tale of ' ' Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad ' ' ) . # European Renaissance to Romanticism # Renaissance magic took a revived interest in the occult , including necromancy . In the era of the Reformation and Counter Reformation , there was frequently a backlash against unwholesome interest in the dark arts , typified by writers such as Thomas Erastus . The Swiss Reformed pastor Ludwig Lavater supplied one of the most frequently reprinted books of the period with his ' ' Of Ghosts and Spirits Walking By Night . ' ' The Child ballad Sweet William 's Ghost ( 1868 ) recounts the story of a ghost returning to his fiance begging her to free him from his promise to marry her . He can not marry her because he is dead but her refusal would mean his damnation . This reflects a popular British belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new love without some formal release . The Unquiet Grave expresses a belief even more widespread , found in various locations over Europe : ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living , whose mourning interferes with the dead 's peaceful rest . In many folktales from around the world , the hero arranges for the burial of a dead man . Soon after , he gains a companion who aids him and , in the end , the hero 's companion reveals that he is in fact the dead man . Instances of this include the Italian fairy tale Fair Brow and the Swedish The Bird ' Grip ' . # Modern period of western culture # # #Spiritualist movement# # ----- EDITORIAL NOTE ----- -- **379;8839;!-- Spiritualism is a monotheistic belief system or religion , postulating a belief in God , but with a distinguishing feature of belief that spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world can be contacted by mediums , who can then provide information about the afterlife . By 1897 , it was said to have more than eight million followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle and upper classes , while the corresponding movement in continental Europe and Latin America is known as Spiritism . The religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization , attaining cohesion by periodicals , tours by trance lecturers , camp meetings , and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums . Many prominent Spiritualists were women . Most followers supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women 's suffrage . By the late 1880s , credibility of the informal movement weakened , due to accusations of fraud among mediums , and formal Spiritualist organizations began to appear . Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational Spiritualist Churches in the United States and United Kingdom . # #Spiritism# # ---- EDITORIAL NOTE ---- -- **376;9220;!-- Spiritism , or French spiritualism , is based on the five books of the Spiritist Codification written by French educator Hypolite Lon Denizard Rivail under the pseudonym Allan Kardec reporting sances in which he observed a series of phenomena that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence ( spirits ) . His assumption of spirit communication was validated by many contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied the phenomena . His work was later extended by writers like Leon Denis , Arthur Conan Doyle , Camille Flammarion , Ernesto Bozzano , Chico Xavier , Divaldo Pereira Franco , Waldo Vieira , Johannes Greber and others . Spiritism has adherents in many countries throughout the world , including Spain , United States , Canada , Japan , Germany , France , England , Argentina , Portugal and especially Brazil , which has the largest proportion and greatest number of followers . # Scientific view # The physician John Ferriar wrote ' ' An essay towards a theory of apparitions ' ' in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of ghosts were the result of optical illusions . Later the French physician Alexandre Jacques Franois Brire de Boismont published ' ' On Hallucinations : Or , the Rational History of Apparitions , Dreams , Ecstasy , Magnetism , and Somnambulism ' ' in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of hallucinations . David Turner , a retired physical chemist , suggested that ball lightning could cause inanimate objects to move erratically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was no credible scientific evidence that any location was inhabited by spirits of the dead . According to research in anomalistic psychology visions of ghosts may arise from hypnagogic hallucinations ( waking dreams which are experienced in the transitional states to and from sleep ) . In a study of two experiments into alleged hauntings ( Wiseman ' ' et al ' ' . 2003 ) came to the conclusion that people consistently report unusual experiences in haunted areas because of environmental factors , which may differ across locations . Some of these factors included the variance of local magnetic fields , size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware . Some researchers , such as Michael Persinger of Laurentian University , Canada , have speculated that changes in geomagnetic fields ( created , e.g. , by tectonic stresses in the Earth 's crust or solar activity ) could stimulate the brain 's temporal lobes and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings . Sound is thought to be another cause of supposed sightings . Richard Lord and Richard Wiseman have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a room , such as anxiety , extreme sorrow , a feeling of being watched , or even the chills . Carbon monoxide poisoning , which can cause changes in perception of the visual and auditory systems , was speculated upon as a possible explanation for haunted houses as early as 1921. # By religion # # Judo-Christian # The Hebrew Torah and the Bible contain a few references to ghosts , associating spiritism with forbidden occult activities . The most notable reference is in the First Book of Samuel , in which a disguised King Saul has the Witch of Endor summon the spirit/ghost of Samuel . In the New Testament , Jesus has to persuade the Disciples that He is not a ghost following the resurrection , Luke 24:3739 ( some versions of the Bible , such as the KJV and NKJV , use the term spirit ) . Similarly , Jesus ' followers at first believe Him to be a ghost ( spirit ) when they see him walking on water . Most of the Christian Church Some ghosts are actually said to be demons in disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timothy 4:1 , that they come to deceive people and draw them away from God and into bondage . As a result , attempts to contact the dead may lead to unwanted contact with a demon or an unclean spirit , as was said to occur in the case of Robbie Mannheim , a fourteen-year-old Maryland youth . The Seventh-Day Adventist view is that a soul is not equivalent to spirit or ghost ( depending on the Bible version ) , and that save for the Holy Spirit , all spirits/ghosts are demons in disguise . Furthermore , they teach that in accordance with ( Genesis 2:7 , Ecclesiastes 12:7 ) , there are only two components to a soul , neither of which survives death - with each returning to its respective source . Christadelphians reject the view of a living , conscious soul after death . The Talmud tells of a being called a shade that is similar to other creatures in that it lives and dies but consists only of a form but lacks matter that forms mass , thus rendering it invisible .

Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia ; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes , believed to be the giraffes ghosts by the Humr. # European folklore # Belief in ghosts in European folklore is characterized by the recurring fear of returning or ' ' revenant ' ' deceased who may harm the living . This includes the Scandinavian ' ' gjenganger ' ' , the Romanian ' ' strigoi ' ' , the Serbian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vrykolakas ' ' , etc . In Scandinavian and Finnish tradition , ghosts appear in corporeal form and their supernatural nature is given away by behavior rather than appearance . In fact , in many stories they are first mistaken for the living . They may be mute , appear and disappear suddenly , or leave no footprints or other traces . British folklore is particularly notable for its numerous haunted locations . Belief in the soul and an afterlife remained near universal until the emergence of atheism in the 18th century . In the 19th century , spiritism resurrected belief in ghosts as the object of systematic inquiry , and popular opinion in Western culture remains divided . # South and Southeast Asia # # #India# # -- **378;9598;!-- A ' ' bhoot ' ' or ' ' bhut ' ' ( , , or ) is a supernatural creature , usually the ghost of a deceased person , in the popular culture , literature and some ancient texts of the Indian subcontinent .

This could be a violent death , unsettled matters in their lives , or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals . In Central and Northern India , ' ' Aojha ' ' spirit guides play a central role . It duly happens when in the night someone sleeps and decorates something on the wall and they say that if one sees the spirit the next thing in the morning he will become a spirit to and that to a skondho kata which means a spirit without a head and the soul of the body will remain the dark with the dark lord from the spirits who reside in the body of every human in Central and Northern India .

There are also many references to Ghosts in Filipino culture , ranging from ancient legendary creatures such as the Manananggal and Tiyanak to more modern urban legends and horror films . The beliefs , legends and stories are as diverse as the people of the Philippines . There was widespread belief in ghosts in Polynesian culture , some of which persists today . After death , a person 's ghost normally traveled to the sky world or the underworld , but some could stay on earth . In many Polynesian legends , ghosts were often actively involved in the affairs of the living . Ghosts might also cause sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be driven out through strong medicines . Phi Hua Kat , Phi Pop , Phi Phong , Phi Phraya and Mae Nak has its origins in Thai films that have now become classics .

The modern state of Mexico before the Spanish conquest was inhabited by diverse peoples such as the Maya and Aztec , and their beliefs have survived and evolved , combined with the beliefs of the Spanish colonists . The Day of the Dead incorporates pre-Columbian beliefs with Christian elements . Mexican literature and films include many stories of ghosts interacting with the living . # #United States# # According to the Gallup Poll News Service , belief in haunted houses , ghosts , communication with the dead , and witches had an especially steep increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 32 percent of Americans believe in ghosts . # Depiction in the arts # Ghosts are prominent in the popular cultures of various nations . The ghost story is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral folktales to works of literature . # Renaissance to Romanticism ( 1500 to 1840 ) # One of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature is the shade of Hamlet 's murdered father in Shakespeares ' ' The Tragical History of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark ' ' . In ' ' Hamlet ' ' , it is the ghost who demands that Prince Hamlet investigate his murder most foul and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle , King Claudius . In Shakespeares ' ' Macbeth ' ' , the murdered Banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character . In English Renaissance theater , ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor , as with the ghost of Hamlets father . Armor , being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance , gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity . But the sheeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness : it clanked and creaked , and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators . These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clichd stage elements . Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass , in ' ' Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory ' ' , point out , In fact , it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of ' spirit drapery ' . An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries , particularly the Border Ballads of the turbulent border country between England and Scotland . Ballads of this type include ' ' The Unquiet Grave ' ' , ' ' The Wife of Usher 's Well ' ' , and ' ' Sweet William 's Ghost ' ' , which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children . In the ballad ' ' King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed . The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman . One of the key early appearances by ghosts in a gothic tale was ' ' The Castle of Otranto ' ' by Horace Walpole in 1764 . Washington Irving 's short story ' ' The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ' ' ( 1820 ) , based on an earlier German folktale , features a Headless Horseman . It has been adapted for film and television many times , such as ' ' Sleepy Hollow ' ' , a successful 1999 feature film . # Victorian/Edwardian ( 1840 to 1920 ) # The classic ghost story arose during the Victorian period , and included authors such as M. R. James , Sheridan Le Fanu , Violet Hunt , and Henry James . Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition , and contain elements of folklore and psychology . M. R.

Famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of ' ' A Christmas Carol ' ' , in which Ebenezer Scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague Jacob Marley , and the ghosts of Christmas Past , Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come . Oscar Wilde 's comedy ' ' The Canterville Ghost ' ' has been adapted for film and television on several occasions . Henry James 's ' ' The Turn of the Screw ' ' has also appeared in a number of adaptations , notably the film ' ' The Innocents ' ' and Benjamin Britten 's opera ' ' The Turn of the Screw ' ' . Oscar Telgmann 's opera ' ' Leo , the Royal Cadet ' ' ( 1885 ) includes ' ' Judge 's Song ' ' about a ghost at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston , Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things ' ' is a 1904 collection of Japanese ghost stories collected by Lafcadio Hearn , and later made into a film . In the United States , prior to and during the First World War , folklorists Olive Dame Campbell and Cecil Sharp collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains , which included ghostly themes such as ' ' The Wife of Usher 's Well ' ' , ' ' The Suffolk Miracle ' ' , ' ' The Unquiet Grave ' ' , and ' ' The Cruel Ship 's Carpenter ' ' . The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover . These songs were variants of traditional British ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo-Scottish border region . # Modern Era ( 1920 to 1970 ) # Professional parapsychologists and ghosts hunters , such as Harry Price , active in the 1920s and 1930s , and Peter Underwood , active in the 1940s and 1950s , published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as Price 's ' ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' ' Ghosts of Borley ' ' ( both recounting experiences at Borley Rectory ) .

Nol Coward 's play ' ' Blithe Spirit ' ' , later made into a film , places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations . With the advent of motion pictures and television , screen depictions of ghosts became common , and spanned a variety of genres ; the works of Shakespeare , Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions . Novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema , although that of ' ' The Haunting of Hill House ' ' to ' ' The Haunting ' ' in 1963 is an exception . Sentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror , and include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' , which was later adapted to television with a successful 196870 TV series . Genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944 's ' ' The Uninvited ' ' , and 1945 's ' ' Dead of Night ' ' . # Post-modern ( 1970present ) # The 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror . A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger , often with unfinished business , such as 1989 's ' ' Field of Dreams ' ' , the 1990 film ' ' Ghost ' ' , and the 1993 comedy ' ' Heart and Souls ' ' . In the horror genre , 1980 's ' ' The Fog ' ' , and the ' ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' ' series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence .

It is also represented in children 's television by such programs as ' ' The Ghost Hunter ' ' and ' ' Ghost Trackers ' ' . Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations , and ghost hunting how-to manuals . The 1990s saw a return to classic gothic ghosts , whose dangers were more psychological than physical . Examples of films from this period include 1999 's ' ' The Sixth Sense ' ' and ' ' The Others ' ' .

As a consequence of the Soviet occupation both countries are home to a large number of ethnic Russians ( 26.9% in Latvia and 25.5% in Estonia ) , some of whom are non-citizens . Latvia is historically predominantly Protestant Lutheran , except for the Latgale region in the southeast , which has historically been predominantly Roman Catholic . The Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918 . However , its de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II . In 1940 , the country was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union , invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and re-occupied by the Soviets in 1944 to form the Latvian SSR for the next fifty years .

The first missionaries , sent by the Pope , sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century , seeking converts . The local people , however , did not convert to Christianity as readily as hoped . German crusaders were sent into Latvia to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs by force of arms . In the beginning of the 13th century , large parts of today 's Latvia were ruled by Germans . Together with Southern Estonia , these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia .

After the Livonian War ( 15581583 ) , Livonia ( Latvia ) fell under Polish and Lithuanian rule . The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the ' ' Ducatus Ultradunensis ' ' ( Prdaugavas hercogiste ) . Gotthard Kettler , the last Master of the Order of Livonia , formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia . Though the duchy was a vassal state to Poland , it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century .

In Latvia , the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive ; serfdom was eased , a network of schools was established for the peasantry , and the power of the regional barons was diminished . Several important cultural changes occurred during this time . Under Swedish and largely German rule , western Latvia adopted Lutheranism as its main religion . The ancient tribes of the Couronians , Semigallians , Selonians , Livs and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people , speaking one Latvian language . Throughout all the centuries , however , no such thing as a Latvian state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective .

In practice , however , the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility , as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation , forcing them to return to work at the estates of their own free will . During the 19th century , the social structure changed dramatically . A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land , but many landless peasants remained . There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian bourgeoisie . The Young Latvian ( ) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century , many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order . The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening . Russification began in Latgale after the Polish led the January Uprising in 1863 : this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s . The Young Latvians were largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political movement , in the 1890s . Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution , which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces . During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom ports were expanded ( Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire ) , railways built ; new factories , banks and University were established ; many residential , public ( theatres and museums ) and school buildings erected ; new parks formed ; etc . Riga 's boulevards and streets with beautiful buildings outside the Old Town date from this period . # Declaration of Independence # World War I devastated the territory of what would become the state of Latvia , including other western parts of the Russian Empire . Demands for self-determination were at first confined to autonomy , but the Russian 1917 Revolution , treaty with Germany at Brest-Litovsk , and allied armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918 , created a power vacuum . The People 's Council of Latvia proclaimed the independence of the new country in Riga on 18 November 1918 , with Krlis Ulmanis becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe . By the spring of 1919 , there were actually three governmentsUlmanis 's government ; the Latvian Soviet government led by Pteris Stuka , whose forces , supported by the Red Army , occupied almost all of the country ; and the Baltic German government of the United Baltic Duchy , headed by Andrievs Niedra and supported by the Baltische Landeswehr and the German Freikorps unit ' ' Iron Division ' ' . Estonian and Latvian forces A freely elected Constituent assembly convened on 1 May 1920 , and adopted a liberal constitution , the ' ' Satversme ' ' , in February 1922 . The constitution was partly suspended by Krlis Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990 . Since then , it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today . With most of Latvia 's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915 , radical land reform was the central political question for the young state . In 1897 , 61.2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that percentage had been reduced to 18% . By 1923 , the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level . Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy , but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great Depression . Latvia showed signs of economic recovery , and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period . On 15 May 1934 , Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup , establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940 . After 1934 , Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of Latvianising the economy . # Latvia in World War II # Early in the morning of 24 August 1939 , the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact , called the MolotovRibbentrop Pact . The pact contained a secret protocol , revealed only after Germany 's defeat in 1945 , according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet spheres of influence . In the North , Latvia , Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective portions of Poland . After the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , most of the Baltic Germans left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis ' government and Nazi Germany under the Heim ins Reich programme . In total 50,000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939 , with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in Latvia . Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940 , when a second resettlement On 5 October 1939 , Latvia was forced to accept a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union , granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory . After staging border incidents , on 16 June 1940 the government of the USSR handed the Latvian ambassador in Moscow a note , in which Latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 October 1939 , and demands were made for sending in additional Soviet troops and to change the government . The Latvian government capitulated in the face of overwhelming force . On 17 June Soviet troops invaded Latvian territory . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning . This is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government , which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between Latvia and the Soviet Union . It is , therefore , my wish that the residents of our country also show friendship towards the advancing military units .. The government has resigned . I shall remain in my place , you remain in yours . # No opposition was shown towards the Soviet forces ; on the contrary , part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm , which was heavily exploited by Soviet propaganda . The well known Russian lawyer and public figure of Latvia , Pyotr Yakobi , wrote : # Taken from the German model , the authoritarian beginning in our country has turned into a government of national bureaucracy , having satisfied a limited circle of citizens , who have adapted themselves to the state pie . Clearly , any hardship is not in vain . And so now the down-trodden have raised their voice and demand a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those unhappy with the regime of Krlis Ulmanis included people who were anxious about the deteriorating economic situation and had no desire to end up under Nazi German rule . State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres , in which 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed . Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions . The resulting people 's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR , which the Soviet Union granted . Latvia , then a puppet government , was headed by Augusts Kirhenteins . The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940 , as The ' ' Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic . ' ' The Soviets dealt harshly with their opponents prior to the German invasion , in less than a year , at least 27,586 people were arrested . Most were deported for cooperating with the German army , and about 945 were shot . Under German occupation , Latvia was administered as part of ' ' Reichskommissariat Ostland ' ' . Latvian paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by the occupation authority participated in the Holocaust as well . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including approximately 75,000 Latvian Jews murdered during the Nazi occupation . Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict , including in the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS , most of them conscripted by the occupying Nazi and Soviet authorities . # Soviet era ( 19401941 , 19441991 ) # In 1944 , when Soviet military advances reached the area , heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops , which ended in another German defeat . In the course of the war , both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies , in this way increasing the loss of the nation 's live resources . In 1944 , part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control . The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system . After the German surrender , it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay , and Latvian national partisans , soon joined by German collaborators , began to fight against the new occupier . Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or , during few months immediately after the end of war , returned by the West . The Soviets reoccupied the country in 19441945 , and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised and Sovieticised . On 25 March 1949 , 43,000 rural residents ( kulaks ) and Latvian patriots ( nationalists ) were deported to Siberia in a sweeping Operation Priboi in all three Baltic states , which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on 29 January 1949 . An extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in Latvia , limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favour of using Russian as the main language . All of the minority schools ( Jewish , Polish , Belorussian , Estonian , Lithuanian ) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools : Latvian and Russian . An influx of labourers , administrators , military personnel and their dependants from Russia and other Soviet republics started . By 1959 about 400,000 people arrived from other Soviet republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists , Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union 's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia . New industry was created in Latvia , including a major machinery factory RAF in Jelgava , electrotechnical factories in Riga , chemical factories in Daugavpils , Valmiera and Olaineand some food and oil processing plants . Latvia manufactured trains , ships , minibuses , mopeds , telephones , radios and hi-fi systems , electrical and diesel engines , textiles , furniture , clothing , bags and luggage , shoes , musical instruments , home appliances , watches , tools and equipment , aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods . Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory ( LPs ) . However , there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories . To maintain and expand industrial production , skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union , decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic . Population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the 1980s , Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called glasnost and perestroika . In the summer of 1987 , the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monumenta symbol of independence . In the summer of 1988 , a national movement , coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia , was opposed by the Interfront . The Latvian SSR , along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy , and in 1988 , the old pre-war Flag of Latvia flew again , replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990 . In 1989 , the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a resolution on the ' ' Occupation of the Baltic states ' ' , in which it declared the occupation not in accordance with law , and not the will of the Soviet people . Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections . On 4 May 1990 , the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic of Latvia , and the Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia . However , the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991 . In January 1991 , Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions . During the transitional period , Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia . In spite of this , 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991 , in a nonbinding advisory referendum . The Popular Front of Latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship . However , universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted . A majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship . Many of them were born in Latvia , but still became non-citizens . By 2011 , more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalisation exams and received Latvian citizenship . Still , today there are 290,660 non-citizens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no citizenship of any country , and can not vote in Latvia . The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991 , in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt . The Saeima , Latvia 's parliament , was again elected in 1993 . Russia ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the Skrunda-1 radar station in 1998 . The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s , to join NATO and the European Union , were achieved in 2004 . Language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many Russophones . Citizenship was not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the Soviet occupation , or to their offspring . Children born to non-nationals after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled to citizenship . Approximately 72% of Latvian citizens are Latvian , while 20% are Russian ; less than 1% of non-citizens are Latvian , while 71% are Russian .

Since the year 2000 , Latvia has had one of the highest ( GDP ) growth rates in Europe . However , the chiefly consumption-driven growth in Latvia resulted in the collapse of the Latvian GDP in late 2008 and early 2009 , exacerbated by the global economic crisis , shortage of credit and huge money resources needed for bailout of Parex bank .

The national account deficit for 2007 , for example , represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while inflation was running at 10% . Latvia 's unemployment rate rose sharply in this period from a low of 5.4% in November 2007 to over 22% . In April 2010 Latvia had the highest unemployment rate in the EU , at 22.5% , ahead of Spain , which had 19.7% . Paul Krugman , the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008 , wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed column on 15 December 2008 : : The most acute problems are on Europes periphery , where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia : Latvia is the new Argentina However , by 2010 , commentators noted signs of stabilisation in the Latvian economy . Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor 's raised its outlook on Latvia 's debt from negative to stable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 27% in late 2006 was in surplus in February 2010 . Kenneth Orchard , senior analyst at Moody 's Investors Service argued that : : The strengthening regional economy is supporting Latvian production and exports , while the sharp swing in the current account balance suggests that the countrys internal devaluation is working . The IMF concluded the First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia in July 2012 announcing that Latvias economy has been recovering strongly since 2010 , following the deep downturn in 200809 . Real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 was underpinned by export growth and a recovery in domestic demand . The growth momentum has continued into 2012 and 2013 despite deteriorating external conditions , and the economy is expected to expand by 4.1 percent in 2014 . The unemployment rate has receded from its peak of more than 20 percent in 2010 to around 9.3 percent in 2014. # Infrastructure # The transport sector is around 14% of GDP . Transit between Russia , Belarus , Kazakhstan as well as other Asian countries and the West is large . Three biggest ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liepja . Most transit traffic uses these and half the cargo is crude oil and oil products . Free port of Ventspils is the busiest port in the Baltic states . Apart from road and railway connections , Ventspils is also linked to oil extraction fields and transportation routes of Russian Federation via system of two pipelines from Polotsk , Belarus . Riga International Airport is the busiest airport in the Baltic states with 4.7 million passengers in 2012 . It has direct flight to over 80 destinations in 30 countries . airBaltic is the Latvian flag carrier airline and a low-cost carrier . Latvia has three big hydroelectric power stations in Paviu HE S ( 825MW ) , Rgas HE S ( 402 MW ) and eguma HES-2 ( 192 MW ) . In the recent years a couple of dozen of wind farms as well as biogas or biomass power stations of different scale have been built in Latvia . Latvia operates Inukalns underground gas storage facility , one of the largest underground gas storage facilities in Europe and the only one in the Baltic states . Unique geological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable for underground gas storage . # Demographics # The total fertility rate ( TFR ) in 2013 was estimated at 1.34 children born/woman , which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1 . In 2012 , 45.0% of births were to unmarried women . The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 73.19 years ( 68.13 years male , 78.53 years female ) . # Ethnic groups # Latvia 's population has been multiethnic for centuries , though the demographics shifted dramatically in the 20th century due to the World Wars , the emigration and removal of Baltic Germans , the Holocaust , and occupation by the Soviet Union . According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897 , Latvians formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million ; Russians accounted for 12% , Jews for 7.4% , Germans for 6.2% , and Poles for 3.4% .

There were 290,660 non-citizens living in Latvia or 14.1% of Latvian residents , mainly ethnic Russians who arrived after the occupation of 1940 and their descendants . In some cities , e.g. Daugavpils and Rzekne , ethnic Latvians constitute a minority of the total population . Despite the fact that the proportion of ethnic Latvians has been steadily increasing for more than a decade , ethnic Latvians also make up slightly less than a half of the population of the capital city of Latvia Rga . The share of ethnic Latvians had fallen from 77% ( 1,467,035 ) in 1935 to 52% ( 1,387,757 ) in 1989 .

Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct Livonian language of the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or distinct separate language of Latvian is also formally protected by Latvian law but only as a historical variation of the Latvian language . Russian , which was widely spoken during the Soviet period , is still the most widely used minority language by far ( about 34% speak it at home , including persons who are not ethnically Russian ) . While it is now required that all school students learn Latvian , most schools also include English and either German or Russian in their curricula . The English language is widely accepted in Latvia , especially in business and tourism . As of 2014 there are 109 schools for minorities that use Russian as the language of instruction for 40% of subjects ( the rest 60% of subjects are taught in Latvian ) , however Latvian government is planning to completely abolish Russian as the language of instruction by 2018 . On 18 February 2012 , Latvia held a constitutional referendum on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language . According to the Central Election Commission , 74.8% voted against , 24.88% voted for and the voter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latvia 's Russian speaking community ( 290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia 's entire population ) could not vote in this referendum because they hold non-citizen status and thus have no right to vote . # Religion # The largest religion in Latvia is Christianity , though only about 7% of the population attends religious services regularly . The largest groups as of 2011 were : * Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia 708,773 *Russian Orthodox 370,000 The country 's Orthodox Christians belong to the Latvian Orthodox Church , a semi-autonomous body within the Russian Orthodox Church . In 2011 , there were 416 Jews and 319 Muslims living in Latvia . There are more than 600 Latvian neopagans , ' ' Dievturi ' ' ( The Godskeepers ) , whose religion is based on Latvian mythology . About 21% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion . # Education # Riga Technical University and University of Latvia are two major universities in the country , both been established on the basis of Riga Polytechnical Institute and located in Riga . Another two important universities , which were established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latvia University of Agriculture ( established in 1939 on the basis of the Faculty of Agriculture ) and Riga Stradi University ( established in 1950 on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine ) both nowadays cover a variety of different fields . Daugavpils University is another significant centre of education . Latvia closed 131 schools between 2006 and 2010 , which is a 12.9% decline , and in the same period enrolment in educational institutions has fallen by over 54,000 people , a 10.3% decline . # Health # The Latvian healthcare system is a universal programme , largely funded through government taxation . It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe , due to excessive waiting times for treatment , insufficient access to the latest medicines , and other factors . There were 59 hospitals in Latvia in 2009 , down from 94 in 2007 , and 121 in 2006 . Corruption is relatively widespread in the Latvian healthcare system , though the situation has improved since the early 1990s . It has been noted that an environment conducive to corruption has been promulgated by low salaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain , mostly to Western EU nations . As of 2009 , there were approximately 8,600 inhabitants of Latvia living with HIV/AIDS , accounting for a 0.7% adult HIV prevalence rate .

In 2005 , Latvia had a suicide rate of 24.5 per 100,000 inhabitants ( down from 40.7 in 1995 ) , the 7th highest in the world . # Culture # Traditional Latvian folklore , especially the dance of the folk songs , date back well over a thousand years . More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified . Between the 13th and 19th centuries , Baltic Germans , many of whom were originally of non-German ancestry but had been assimilated into German culture , formed the upper class . They developed distinct cultural heritage , characterised by both Latvian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day , in spite of their dispersal to Germany , the USA , Canada and other countries in the early 20th century . However , most indigenous Latvians did not participate in this particular cultural life . Thus , the mostly peasant local pagan heritage was preserved , partly merging with Christian traditions . For example , one of the most popular celebrations is Ji , a pagan celebration of the summer solsticewhich Latvians celebrate on the feast day of St. John the Baptist . In the 19th century , Latvian nationalist movements emerged . They promoted Latvian culture and encouraged Latvians to take part in cultural activities . The 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often regarded as a classical era of Latvian culture . Posters show the influence of other European cultures , for example , works of artists such as the Baltic-German artist Bernhard Borchert and the French Raoul Dufy . With the onset of World War II , many Latvian artists and other members of the cultural elite fled the country yet continued to produce their work , largely for a Latvian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important event in Latvian culture and social life . It has been held since 1873 , normally every five years . Approximately 30,000 performers altogether participate in the event . Although usually folksongs and classical choir songs are sung , with emphasis on a cappella singing , recently modern popular songs have been incorporated into the repertoire as well . After incorporation into the Soviet Union , Latvian artists and writers were forced to follow the Socialist realism style of art . During the Soviet era , music became increasingly popular , with the most popular being songs from the 1980s . At this time , songs often made fun of the characteristics of Soviet life and were concerned about preserving Latvian identity . This aroused popular protests against the USSR and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry . Since independence , theatre , scenography , choir During July 2014 , Riga will host the 8th World Choir Games as it plays host to over 27 000 choristers representing over 450 choirs and over 70 countries .
