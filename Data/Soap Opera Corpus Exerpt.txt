Jake 's with her right now . @!Brooke: All right , tell Laura I will be right there . @!Edmund: I will . And listen , bring Leo if you see him , okay ? She 's been calling for him . I do n't think she 'll calm down until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read tan lines . And this one on your ring finger tells me that there 's a wife in the picture . @!Leo: Is that going to be a problem ? # @!Laura: I need Leo ! Where 's Leo ? @!Jake: Laura , Laura , you 're hyperventilating . You need to relax and just slow down your breathing . @!Laura: I need Leo ! @!Jake: All right , I 'm going get you on this oxygen here . I 'm going to -- @!Laura: I do n't want that ! I want Leo ! I want my husband ! # @!Liza: Oh , Ryan . I 'm so sorry about your mom . Tell me what I can do . @(Pounding-on-door) @!Liza: Adam . @!Adam: So this is where you came to get away from it all ? @!Liza: Adam , leave it to you . @!Adam: What , to find you out ? You did n't need time to find yourself or sort out our marriage . You wanted to be alone with your lover ! @!Liza: Well , thank you for the wonderful homecoming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shacking up with your muscle-bound Romeo here . @!Liza: You know , keep talking . Remind me of why I needed to get away to begin with . @!Adam: Where 's Colby ? @!Liza: Well , oh , we sent her on a liquor run . @!Adam: Damn it ! Did you do it with her here in this room ? Have you no decency ? @!Liza: Have you no shame ? Do you see our daughter ? @!Adam: What have you done with my daughter ? @!Liza: Your daughter is with her grandmother who picked us up at the airport this afternoon . @!Adam: You expect me to believe that ? @!Liza: Well , it 's the truth , whether you like it or not . Actually , I have the airline tickets . Would you like to see them ? But I 'm sure they do n't fit into your fantasy . @!Adam: Why did n't you go straight home ? @!Liza: Is n't it obvious ? @!Adam: I saw you with your arms around each other . @!Liza: You make jumping to conclusions an Olympic event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing in Lavery 's motel room ? @!Liza: And what are you doing peeping through the window ? @!Adam: Do n't -- do n't confuse the issues ! @!Liza: I 'm not confusing the issues here . The issue is that you wanted to have a face-to-face with Ryan . You wanted to cause a lot of trouble , even though you promised not to ! @!Adam: I 'm here because I was worried about you ! @!Liza: Oh , really ? @!Adam: Yes , really ! You 've been calling me every day before you put Colby down for her nap so I could talk with her . Today no phone call . @!Liza: Because we were on our way home . @!Adam: How in the hell was I supposed to know that ? @!Liza: You were n't supposed to know it , it was a surprise ! But just like you , you have to ruin everything . @!Adam: Let 's talk about this at home . @!Liza: You know what ? I just -- I do n't think that 's such a great idea . @!Ryan: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay out of this , Lavery ! @!Ryan: Do n't pop a vein , Chandler . This time I 'm on your side . # @!Jesse: Thaddeus has a case of runaway rage . And I 'm here to put the brakes on . @!Tad: No -- @!Jesse: Yes ! @!Tad: Matter how weird this looks , Honey , I -- I promise you I am not a nut ball . @!Jesse: You are such a hardheaded fool , man . You still wo n't listen to me . @!Tad: Honey , um -- do me a favor , Sweetie . Let 's -- let 's have a seat over here , shall we ? @!Dixie: Okay . I am a little worried about you . @!Tad: Oh , no . Do n't be . I 'm -- I 'm fine . Really , I 'm -- really , I 'm okay . I just -- I 'm a little strung-out . @!Dixie: I can see that . About what ? @!Tad: Well , for one thing , David Hayward is at it again . @!Dixie: At what ? @!Tad: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to be Chief of Staff of the hospital ? @!Tad: So bad he can taste it . @!Dixie: I do n't believe it . @!Jesse: Oh , believe it , Dixie . It 's a known fact . @!Tad: It 's true . True , it 's -- it 's all over the hospital . Dad is -- I mean , David is trashing Dad 's name all over the hospital . He 's trying to make him appear incompetent . He wants to set up a case of review before the hospital board . @!Dixie: Well , that 's terrible , but it does n't explain why you were yelling when I walked in here . @!Tad: Oh , Dixie , are you kidding ? I was so angry at David , I wanted to pound him into the ground . Something -- stopped me . @!Jesse: Please hold your applause till the end . @!Tad: I ran in here so I could -- you know , I could blow off some steam -- you know , rant and rave a little bit , read David the riot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , man . You 've done that before , have n't you ? You know , you rehashed arguments in your mind , given somebody what for when they were n't there ? @!Dixie: Yeah , I guess . @!Tad: Well , see , that 's the same thing . That 's exactly what was going on . I was just -- I was here , I was letting David have it , but this way , no actual human beings were hurt . @!Jesse: Boy , you a train wreck waiting to happen . You know that ? @!Dixie: It just worries me , you know , that you let David upset you still so much . @!Tad: I 'm not upset , Sweetie . I had my thing . It 's all over . It 's over and done . @!Dixie: Are you sure ? You know , because you remember what happened with the whole Sweeney thing . @!Tad: Oh , no , baby , I swear to you . I give you my word that I 'm not about to do anything stupid . Honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've knocked some sense into me because I ended up having a little chat with my conscience , you know -- smug , self-righteous , Jiminy Cricket wannabe . And I -- and I -- I -- I realized something very important . @!Dixie: What 's that ? @!Tad: As satisfying as killing David Hayward would be , it 's just not worth risking what you and I have together . See , I never want to give anybody that much power over you and me , especially not David . He 's just not worth it . # @!Brooke: Edmund ? How is Laura ? Has there been any change ? @!Edmund: Jake 's still examining her . @!Brooke: I want to see her . @!Edmund: Where 's Leo ? @!Brooke: I have no idea . Laura . @!Jake: Brooke . @!Brooke: Honey , honey , how are you doing ? How is she , Jake ? @!Jake: Well , better than when she came in . @!Laura: Mom . Where 's Leo ? I need him . Just tell me where he is . @(Laura-wheezes) @!Brooke: Honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the airport . @!Laura: But , Mom , you have to find him . I need him . I need Leo here . @!Brooke: It 's all right . We 'll find him , we 'll find him . It 's okay . @!Jake: Okay , okay . We 're doing our best to track Leo down and I want you just to relax , Laura , and I 'm going to step outside and talk to your mom . @!Laura: No , I do n't want to relax ! I want Leo ! @!Brooke: I know . I know you do . Honey , I understand , all right ? I 'm just going to be right outside . I 'm just going to -- I 'm just going to talk to Jake for a minute , okay ? I 'll be right back . Jake , what -- what is wrong ? Is it her heart ? I mean , she was doing so well . @!Jake: Look , Brooke , physically , Laura is doing fine . Have a seat . Her heartbeat was slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have found . @!Brooke: But something is wrong . I mean , she 's so agitated . I 'd really like it if Dr . Hayward could look at her . @!Jake: Okay , well , Dr . Hayward has been paged . @!Brooke: Okay . @!Jake: But I do n't think she needs to see a cardiologist . At this point , I would recommend a psychiatrist . # @!Liza: How could you side with him ? @!Ryan: You quote me and I 'll deny it , but , Liza , this time he 's right . @!Adam: I do n't need you to defend me , Lavery . @!Ryan: Shut it , Chandler ! Liza , you set out the ground rules , right ? I mean , Adam 's got to follow the game plan . One false move and he 's history . @!Liza: That is not exactly -- @!Ryan: Well , you pretty much rigged it so he ca n't win , Liza . @!Liza: No , he 's good and he can succeed . @!Ryan: You gave him a list of do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . @!Liza: So ? @!Ryan: So what 's he supposed to do ? Sit home and wait for you to decide whether , you know , you want to come back ? He ca n't do that . He 's got to take action . He 's a shark . He swims or he dies . @!Liza: Well , so -- so what , the great white swims up to your doorstep ? @!Ryan: Right . And he finds you in a motel room with a guy . @!Liza: Yeah . @!Ryan: The same -- the same guy that he caught you in bed with . @!Liza: And he jumps to the conclusion that I 'm having another affair with you . @!Ryan: Liza , look at this from his point of view . It did n't look so innocent . @!Adam: Are you finished ? @!Ryan: Almost . Where were you going to go when you left here , Liza ? @!Liza: Home . @!Ryan: Well , then follow the game plan and go home . @!Adam: Liza -- @!Liza: I 'm not going to fight with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . Thank you for your perspective . @!Ryan: Later , Adam . Do n't bother thanking me . # @!Indy: So , what is the story with you and Mrs . Leo ? @!Leo: Uh , boring . @!Indy: I also have a high boredom tolerance . @!Leo: Yeah , well , this will send you over the edge , believe me . @!Indy: Try me . @!Leo: Why ? @!Indy: Why not ? Pour your soul out . You 'll never see me again , so any secrets that you want to share are going to disappear with this bar smoke and me . @!Leo: Okay . You asked for it . The story of Leo and how he fell into a marriage and what happened after that . I -- well , I 've been around the world and tried everything , so I thought I 'd take a stab at being the good guy/husband type . @!Indy: And what happened ? @!Leo: I was n't right for the part . I kept forgetting my lines and what was supposed to do . It just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just like that ? @!Leo: Mm-hmm . Just like that . Never looked back , on to the next adventure . You up for it ? @!Indy: Oh , I 'm up for anything . I 'm just not so sure that you are . @!Leo: Try me . @!Indy: You 're a real B.S . artist , Leo -- not that there 's anything wrong with that . @!Leo: What do you mean ? @!Indy: I mean I 've been around the world just like you and this whole guy-without-a-heart routine -- it 's the worst thing I 've seen since I hit New York . # @!Brooke: Jake , why do you think Laura needs psychiatric help ? @!Jake: Well , Brooke , it seems to me that Laura has worked herself up into a major panic attack . @!Brooke: A panic attack ? @!Jake: She shows all of the symptoms -- uncontrolled anxiety , rapid , shallow breathing , accelerated heartbeat . # @!Phoebe: What 's bothering you , Sweetheart ? @!Laura: Nothing . @!Phoebe: Well , now , you can not fool Dear Aggie , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!Laura: Well , I do n't know . Maybe it 's this whole marriage thing . How do you know when you 're a good wife ? @!Phoebe: Well , have you gotten any complaints ? @!Laura: Not really . I mean , Leo says everything 's fine . @!Phoebe: But you do n't believe him ? @!Laura: I just thought things would be different -- like once you 're married , things would fall into place . @!Phoebe: Oh , no , Darling . Marriage is n't the end of the journey . In fact , it 's only the starting point . @!Laura: Did you and Uncle Langley -- did you guys have problems when you first got married ? @!Phoebe: Did we ever . You see , every marriage has a period of adjustment . You and Leo are only getting to know one another . @!Laura: I know . I just feel like I 'm trying so hard to be what I think he wants . @!Phoebe: Romantic ? @!Laura: And I feel like it 's making him -- both of us -- too self-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not if I keep saying the wrong thing , not if we keep fighting . @!Phoebe: Oh , you 'll fight , all right . But then you 'll make up and that , believe me , is the best part . @!Laura: I hope you 're right . @!Phoebe: Of course I 'm right . @(Alarm-clock-rings) @!Laura: Oh -- time for my meds . @!Phoebe: Time for mine , too . Thanks for the reminder . @!Laura: Oh , really ? Popping pills with my great aunt -- how weird is that ? What are yours for ? @!Phoebe: Oh , they slow down my heart rate . @!Laura: Really ? @!Phoebe: Mm-hmm . @!Laura: Is that bad ? @!Phoebe: Well , when it 's my age , it is . @!Laura: You 're not old , Aunt Phoebe . @!Phoebe: Well , I ca n't turn cartwheels any longer , but I 've learned a few things over the years . Just be patient , darling . @!Laura: I 'm trying . @!Phoebe: Good . I hope I 've helped . @!Laura: Oh . You 've helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Laura: Hmm . # @!Dixie: Well , Honey , I 'm relieved that you want to cross David off your hit list . @!Tad: Well , he 's a complete waste of time . @!Dixie: But I think it 's obvious he still pushes your buttons . @!Tad: Well , baby , I 'd like to think it 's not just me . You know , you should have seen the way he went after my father . He makes him sound like a hazard to his patients . I 've never seen Pop look so devastated . @!Dixie: But everybody knows what a great doctor Joe is . Say he does have to go in front of the board for some reason . He 's going to have the entire hospital staff behind him . @!Tad: Yeah , well , what if Hayward gets to them first ? @!Dixie: There 's a lot of people who would like to see David take a fall . Maybe I could even help give him a little push . @!Tad: Yeah ? Really ? Why ? @!Dixie: Well -- @!Tad: What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of friends when I was working for the Andrassy Foundation . @!Tad: Yeah ? @!Dixie: I could call them up , you know , schmooze them a little bit , tell them how PVH would n't be the great hospital that it is today without Joe 's dedication and leadership . @!Tad: Baby , that 's brilliant . That 's -- hmm , yes ! And you know what ? If we wanted to , we could even start our own little smear campaign against , you know , Dr . Diablo . @!Dixie: Hang on a second , okay ? David is his own worst press agent . Nobody is going to support him over Joe . @!Tad: I wish I had your belief in human nature . @!Dixie: Well , stick with me ; I 'll bring you around . @!Tad: Yeah . @!Dixie: I 'm going to get on this , okay ? Are you going to be all right ? @!Tad: Yeah , yeah , I 'm sure -- fine . I 'm just , you know , waiting for my discharge papers . @!Dixie: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? @!Dixie: For being so good , not letting David control you . I 'm proud of you . @!Tad: Thank you . @!Jesse: Tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk . @!Tad: Listen , you , I want whatever you are out of my noggin , okay ? So you just , you know , be gone . @!Jesse: Oh , do n't be dumb , Tad . You need me now more than ever . @!Tad: No . @!Jesse: Yes , you do . @!Tad: No , no , no . I do n't see -- look , hey , look , I 'm fine . I 'm not going after Hayward . @!Jesse: Boy , you must really think I 'm stupid , huh ? # @!Dixie: Jake , Jake . @!Jake: Hey . @!Dixie: I 'm looking for David Hayward . @!Jake: Well , that makes two of us . @!Dixie: Tad told me he 's trying to oust Joe as Chief of Staff ? @!Jake: Yeah , yeah , it appears that way and that 's what 's got Tad so ticked off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . Does he have a case ? @!Jake: He thinks so . @!Dixie: Somebody 's got to talk to that man . @!Jake: Oh , and that someone would be you ? @!Dixie: Why not ? @!Jake: You know why . @!Dixie: I 'm not going to let him get to me . Honestly , Jake . Where do you think he is , anyway ? @!Jake: I do n't know , beats me , but he 's got a patient waiting for a consult and he 's nowhere to be found . @!Dixie: Great . Well , he ca n't hide from me . # @!Brooke: You did n't seem surprised when Jake recommended that Laura get some psychiatric help . @!Edmund: You may want to consider that . @!Brooke: Well , I mean , why do you think that she needs psychiatric help ? @!Edmund: Brooke , I was at the office when Laura lost it . @!Brooke: Well , do you have any idea what set her off ? @!Edmund: No . Well , I 'm not sure , but she fired that temporary secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was harsh . @!Brooke: She 's not like this , all right ? I do n't understand any of this . @!Edmund: She 's had a pretty rough time since the , you know , transplant . @!Brooke: Leo said before I left for Switzerland that she seemed down . @!Edmund: Leo ? He 's been kind of the focus of her frustration . I 've left messages all over . Where is he , Brooke ? @!Brooke: When I came back from the airport , I stopped over at Laura and Leo 's condo . He was n't there , but I found -- @!Laura: Mom ! Oh , help me ! @!Brooke: Jake ? @!Jake: I heard . Laura , what is it ? @!Laura: I do n't know . I just got so dizzy all of a sudden . @!Jake: Look , just relax , just relax . @!Laura: What 's wrong with me , Jake ? @!Jake: We 're going to find out . Just relax and take deep breaths . @!Brooke: All right , all right , honey . All right , I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm right here , okay ? @!Jake: Deep breaths . # @!Adam: Colby grew while you two were gone . @!Liza: Oh , we were n't gone that long . @!Adam: Yeah , well , she 's -- she 's different somehow . @!Liza: Except when she 's sleeping . @!Adam: Yeah . With that stud lion tucked under her chin , her beautiful hair . Almost as beautiful as her mother . @!Liza: The way you look at her never changes . Watching you watching her sleeping makes me fall in love with you all over again . @!Adam: And then we tiptoe down the steps and the spell is broken . @!Liza: Is it ? @!Adam: Yes , we retreat to our separate corners ; you draw a line in the sand , and dare me to cross it . If I do , well , I 'm a control freak . And if I do n't , I -- I do n't know who I am or what the hell we 're doing here . @!Liza: I thought we were trying to make our marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that your first priority ? @!Liza: What do you think ? @!Adam: I do n't know . First thing you did when you came home was race over to Ryan 's house . @!Liza: There was a reason for that . @!Adam: What , to drive me over the edge ? @!Liza: No , you knew I needed to get away . @!Adam: To punish me ? @!Liza: No , to figure out where we go next . @!Adam: What the hell does Ryan Lavery have to do with our future ? @!Liza: If you would just stop this just for a minute , I would tell you because , Adam , I have made a very important decision about us . @!Adam: So you 've made a decision about us ? @!Liza: Yes . @!Adam: Do I need a drink or a blindfold ? @!Liza: Will you just let me talk ? I realize that , with everything , that I 've lost sight of what 's most important in my life . I mean , even though Colby is the center of my world -- you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture of you in the yearbook ? And under that picture sometimes it 's written " most likely to " whatever . To succeed in business , to get married , to become a millionaire . @!Adam: Uh-huh , yes . @!Liza: Well , under my high school photo , it said " Most likely to be a home-wrecker . " @!Adam: That was cruel . @!Liza: It was accurate . I was n't a very good person . I was as ruthless as you are . @!Adam: That 's not a compliment , I take it ? @!Liza: It 's just -- I 'm just stating a fact . I did n't want to grow up to be that girl in my high school yearbook , known for sleeping around . But when I left home , I looked in the mirror and I was that girl , only the home that I was wrecking was my own . @!Adam: But you still left . @!Liza: I came back . @!Adam: Why ? @!Liza: Because I missed here , I missed you . Our battles , the backhanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why you came home ? @!Liza: It was you . Something you said , you took me back to that time , and I do n't want to be my mother 's daughter . I do n't want to be that kind of mother for Colby . @!Adam: But you went to see Ryan first . @!Liza: I had to make peace for what I did , for turning to him . @!Adam: And did you ? @!Liza: Yes , we did , we both did . Ryan has to find his own way . I do n't -- I do n't want to lose you . I do n't want our marriage to be over . @!Adam: What do you want ? @!Liza: I want you to hold me . I want you to wrap your arms around me and just be with me all night . I want to be in my husband 's bed . # @!Tad: Oh , for God 's sake . Is n't there a castle in Scotland somewhere you can go haunt ? @!Jesse: Oh , shut up , Tad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this dog ai n't biting . @!Tad: What line ? @!Jesse: That you 're going to give Hayward a pass . Ha ! @!Tad: Why 's that so unbelievable ? @!Jesse: Because I saw you with that damn hammer in your hand and that Charles Manson look in your eye . @!Tad: Okay , okay . Jesse , I swear to God -- @!Jesse: Uh-uh-uh-uh . Do n't swear . Does n't sit too well with the big cheese , you know ? @!Tad: Oh , this is ridiculous . You know , you 're not real . I 'm not even having this conversation . @!Jesse: I am real . And I 'm here trying to keep your butt out of trouble . @!Tad: I told you , I 'm not in trouble . @!Jesse: You will be if you go after Hayward . Now , Tad , if this man is half as bad as you say he is , trust me , he 's going to have more then enough to deal with when his time comes . @!Tad: What 's your point ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there really is a -- a down there ? @!Jesse: Tad , we go way back , and I would really like to cut you some slack . @!Tad: No , do n't tell me . I know . I 've seen " It 's A Wonderful Life . " You do n't do your little good deed , you do n't get your wings , right ? @!Jesse: Oh , it ai n't the wings I 'm after , trust me . It 's the powers that be . I mean , they -- they think you still need me around . Otherwise , I 'd be chilling with Jenny . @!Tad: Jenny ? @!Jesse: Jenny . Yeah , she 's a bigger angel there than she was here . @!Tad: Can she see me ? @!Jesse: Hell , yeah , she 's right there . Psych . Made you look . You know , Tad , seriously , it would break Jenny 's heart if you killed the maniac doctor and the both of you-all ended up sharing bunks in that place you call hell . # @!Edmund: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? @!Jake: Well , there 's a new development . I ran another ECG . @!Brooke: And ? @!Jake: And Laura 's heart rate has decelerated abnormally . @!Edmund: Hmm . @!Brooke: Well , what -- what would cause that ? @!Jake: Any number of possibilities . We 're just going to have to run more tests to see . @!Brooke: Oh . So , well , then she did n't have a panic attack ? @!Jake: Apparently not . @!Brooke: Do you think she still needs psychiatric help ? @!Jake: I do n't think it would hurt , but the need is not immediate . But I am sorry for alarming you unnecessarily . @!Brooke: Can I see her ? @!Jake: Well , actually , Laura just fell asleep , but before she nodded off , she did say that she wanted to see Leo . @!Brooke: All right , listen , thank you , Jake . @!Jake: Okay . @!Brooke: So -- so she did n't just have a panic attack . @!Edmund: Well , apparently not . This is good news , yes ? @!Brooke: Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having a breakdown . I just -- you know , I just want to know what is going on with her heart rate . @!Edmund: The doctors will find out , okay ? @!Brooke: Okay . @!Edmund: I 'm sure Laura 's going to be all right . @!Brooke: I hope you 're right . @!Edmund: You going to be all right ? @!Brooke: I 'll be okay . @!Edmund: Got to make a call .

Will I see you before you leave ? @!Dixie: I have things to do . I have to make arrangements for our trip . @!Tad: " Our " trip ? What are you talking about ? You said you were traveling alone .

I do n't -- I 'm not sure I want to hear any more where this is headed . @!Brooke: I do . @!Simone: I overheard Mateo and Hayley talking to Chris Stamp about some crucial info evidence that Ryan Lavery had . He had it stashed for them . And I told my editor about it . @!Brooke: Who blew your cover for it ? @!Simone: My editor was Proteus . @!Edmund: What ? @!Simone: Well , either that or high up on the food chain . I mean , all I know now is that once I did that , I might as well have painted a red bull's-eye on Ryan Lavery 's chest .

Martin needs to examine the patient in private . @!Erica: Joe ? @!Joe: Erica , I will see you after I examine Chris . Please . Yeah . @!Joe: Chris , after the surgery , we took a pretty close look around . There 's a bullet fragment lodged right next to your spine . @!Chris: And -- and you left it there ? @!Joe: We had to . Your life was at stake . Believe me , repairing your heart was one hell of a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to do .

My mother 's not smart enough to pull this off . I know it , believe me ! @!Anna: I think she is . I think she 's brilliant . However , she 's also vulnerable , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe this . @!Anna: Well , she was here . What the hell was she doing here ? You know ? And you said yourself that you heard someone else in here , like maybe she was hiding -- @!David: Yes , yes . She was hiding someone . Of course she was . That 's because the woman is the town slut . Everybody knows that -- what ? What ? What are you doing ? @!Anna: Well , I do n't know who this belongs to . @!David: You 're kidding , right ? This is Greenlee 's apartment , is n't it ? @!Anna: Oh , no . That 's not her style . It 's not flashy enough . This is a cheap earring , like something a young person would wear . @!David: Look -- look -- if -- if Vanessa killed Larry , it was a crime of passion , all right ?

He would have ruined David 's life had he lived . @!Maggie: So this no-killing rule is n't really set in stone , is it ? @(Vanessa-chuckles) @!Vanessa: Charles was my husband , not my family . @!Maggie: You did n't love him ? @!Vanessa: I wanted a child , and Charles served that purpose perfectly well , and he gave me one . @!Maggie: You said before that he -- that he ruined David . What did you mean by that ? @!Vanessa: Well , Charles knew very well that he could n't compete with my love for David , so he took on being the most successful , wealthiest businessman in the world , and he almost pulled the whole thing off , too . @!Maggie: What did he do ? @!Vanessa: Well , my dear , you ca n't make that kind of money totally legally . So we both understood that . But Charles suddenly decided to develop a conscience . He said that he could n't look David in the eye because of the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak ? @!Vanessa: Because Charles ' inability to keep his promises in all the plans that I had for David , and then the -- and then the call came . @!Maggie: What call ? @!Vanessa: Someone called and threatened my son because of the promises that Charles could not keep on the job . So I confronted him . Sniveling idiot sold out our family because he was scared ! So I had to take it over . I had to take it over . I had to keep it all clean . I had to keep it all clean and to keep David safe . So -- @(Vanessa-chuckles) @!Vanessa: Well , that 's the day I made a deal with the devil . @!Maggie: So that 's -- that 's when you started this whole -- whole thing , whatever it is . @!Vanessa: You know , I never looked back . @!Maggie: How did you do it ? @!Vanessa: I bargained .

Oh , I just wish I could 've been here for the real thing , you know ? @!J.R.: Well , you made it to the after-party , did n't you ? @!Tim: So did you beach the boat ? @!J.R.: Yeah . Why , you want to take it out ? @!Tim: Yeah , I do . @!Bianca: So , you and Tim getting along ? @!Maggie: Yeah , I guess . # @!J.R.: Yeah , I barely knew her sister , Frankie . I hooked up with her , though , but I barely knew her . But this Maggie , she seems pretty tight . @!Tim: Yeah , there 's nothing like a chick who knows everything . # @!Edmund: Just wonder what would 've happened if I had n't shown up . @!Brooke: Edmund , you know despite all the craziness that you are the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way I 'll be able to forgive you . @!Brooke: How ? @!Edmund: Tell me what you 're really doing here in the middle of the desert . @!Brooke: I already have . @!Edmund: I need some air . I 'll get the car . @!Brooke: Good . @!Brooke: Yes , can you tell me if Maureen Gorman is still registered at the motel ? She 's checked out ? Thank you . @!Brooke: It 's not her . It could n't be . Maria 's not alive . # @!Leo: Ah . We finally did it . @!Greenlee: Hmm . @!Leo: Despite everyone and everything , we did it . @!Greenlee: We 're husband and wife . @!Leo: Mm-hmm . @!Greenlee: I always thought that that would make life perfect . @!Leo: Me , too . @!Greenlee: But your mother will always be your mother . And now my father 's in critical condition . @!Leo: Greenlee , I do n't know -- I do n't know how I 'm going to do it , but I 'm going to make up for everything . My mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . My father is a money-grubbing leech and a dirty old man . @!Leo: Oh , hey , come on . Now , you gave me the go-ahead to care for Vanessa , and I 'm going to give you the go-ahead to forgive Roger . Okay ? @!Greenlee: But he 's so weak . He 's so messed up . The doctors say that he could -- that he might not -- @!Leo: Shh . Baby , it 's okay . It 's okay . Look . Look . See that ? We 're hooked up forever . No matter what , I 'm going to be right beside you . Okay ? We can take on anything . # @!Jake: Thought those two were on the same side . See you tomorrow , David . @!David: Thanks . # @!Jack: I very strongly suggest that you retain counsel . @!Anna: Yes , I will . But I suggest that you go out there and find criminals to prosecute instead of persecuting me . I 'm a colleague , Jackson . @!Jack: You 'd just better hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , it was torture just standing by , but I thought I should let you fight your own battle . @!Anna: Thanks . @!David: Well , looks like you 've got Jackson on the retreat . @!Anna: No . He thinks the shoot was bad . He 's filed a complaint with the I.A.D . @!David: Internal Affairs ? All right , so what does that mean ? @!Anna: I could lose my job , be sued , brought up on murder charges , spend the rest of my life in jail . I do n't know . # @!Jake: Look at her eyes . @!Zeke: Mm-hmm ? @!Jake: Did you change her meds ? @!Zeke: No , no . Her disassociation trigger has always been self-preservation . This time it was her son . @!Jake: Which one ? @!Zeke: Leo . When she learned he was safe , she just checked out .

I think you did it . @!Erica: Kendall 's entire reason for living has been hating me . Now that Ryan 's gone , she 's going to sleep , eat , and drink revenge . @!Aidan: If you show your face on that site again , I 'm going to call the police . # @!Erica: Opal . Opal , hi . When did this happen ? How is Palmer ? What did the doctors say ? @!Opal: Well , I got a call from Lorraine . You know , that maid at the Valley Inn that I hired to kind of keep an eye on the old goat , give him his three squares a day and everything ? @!Erica: And so , what happened ? @!Opal: Well , she was bringing in his lunch , and when he did n't answer the knock , she let herself in . She found him sprawled out there on the floor . @!Erica: Oh . @!Opal: He could n't catch his breath , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I 'm just waiting to hear . @!Erica: Oh , he is so lucky . I mean , you probably saved his life . Joe . Joe , how is he ? @!Opal: Oh , please tell me that he 's going to be okay . @!Joe: Ladies , I wish I could . # @!Jake: Liza ? Hey . How are you doing ? @!Liza: I 'm good . I 'm just waiting for Dr . Greenberg to bring me my test results . @!Jake: So , where 's the entourage ? @!Liza: The what ? @!Jake: The entourage -- Adam and Mia . I was going to see if I could steal your sister away for a quick bite , if you could spare her . @!Liza: Adam and Mia went home a little while ago . @!Jake: Oh . Oh , well , I guess I 'll just have to book an appointment with Adam if I want to see Mia . Well , in the meantime , listen , why do n't I go grab Greenberg and see what he has to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back . @!Marian: Oh , hi , Jake . @!Jake: Hey , Marian , Stuart . Looking good . @!Marian: Thanks . Right back at you . @!Jake: Good to see you . @!Marian: You , too . Boy , there goes one great guy . And what a catch for Mia , huh ? @!Liza: Well , if Jake is who Mia wants . @!Marian: Well , who would be better suited for Mia than Jake , Darling ? # @!Winifred: Mr . Chandler , this just came from the salon . @!Adam: It 's perfect . She 'll love it . Would you take it up to her bedroom ? @!Winifred: Yes , Sir . @!Trey: Designer threads for the wife who 's embezzling you ? @!Adam: Never mind that . What do you have ? @!Trey: Well , unlike Liza , numbers do n't lie . This should be more than enough for you to divorce your embezzling wife and boot her out of Chandler Enterprises . My advice is to go for the kill now . @!Adam: I 'll decide what to do with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , divorce can be a drawn-out procedure . Unless you 've got something else in store for Liza . # @!Liza: Mother , would you do me a favor ? @!Marian: I 'll do anything for you , my darling . @!Liza: I could n't eat before my tests . Would you go across the street and get me something -- a smoothie , blueberry ? @!Marian: One blueberry smoothie coming up . @!Liza: Thanks . @!Marian: Stuart , why do n't you show Liza the picture that Colby painted for her Mommy ? I 'll be back in a flash , my darling . @!Liza: Okay . @!Marian: Love you . @!Liza: Bye . @!Stuart: This -- yeah , this is -- it 's Colby -- Colby and I have been working on perspective , and this , you can see , Adam 's head is about as big as the house . @!Liza: Yeah . @!Stuart: And look at you . You 're so little . And , of course , there 's Aunt Mia . Liza ? Are you okay ? You do n't seem yourself today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot lately . @!Stuart: Did Colby 's drawing upset you ? # @!Opal: Well , Joe , just give it to me straight , will you ? I mean , what 's wrong ? @!Joe: Opal , I did n't mean to alarm you . Palmer 's condition has stabilized . @!Erica: Well , that 's good news . @!Opal: Yeah , but what is the matter with him ? @!Joe: Exhaustion and dehydration have aggravated his heart condition . And frankly , if he does n't start taking care of himself , the next time , he may not be so lucky . @!Opal: Well , I 'm going to see to it that there is no next time . I mean , that stubborn old coot , he thinks he knows everything . He never follows his doctor 's orders . He 'll think twice when I am done with him . @!Joe: Opal -- Palmer asked me to give you a message . Go home . # @!Singer: Can you still remember how it seemed that we could live forever in a lovers ' dream ? @!Ryan-'s-voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make sure that it stays off for good .

Want to party ? @!Ryan: No , I do n't . I told you what I want . I want quiet . @(Knock-on-door) @!Singer: A silly little love song for myself @!Kendall: Who are you ? @!Man: The name 's Stan . I hear you 're in arrears . @!Kendall: What ? @!Stan: Behind on your motel bill . @!Kendall: Oh , I worked out a deal with Artie , the manager . @!Stan: Well , I 'm the owner . So whatever deal you worked out with Artie is smoke . Which does n't mean that you and I ca n't do business . Do you want to pay , or do you want to play ? @!Stan: So , babe , you be good to me , and I 'll be good to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Kendall: I 'll get you your money . @!Stan: Let me check out your assets . @!Chris: What part of " no " do n't you get ? @!Stan: Hey , man , we 're doing business here . @!Chris: Good . 50 ought to cover a couple of nights in this dump . Now , beat it . @!Stan: You still owe me . I 'll be back to collect . @!Kendall: What a scuz . Thanks , Chris . @!Chris: You can save your gratitude . I just did you a favor , and now you can pay me back . @!Kendall: How ? @!Chris: You leave this town and do n't come back -- ever . @!Kendall: I do n't get you , Stamp . You just paid for me to stay . @!Chris: I just paid the sleaze off so you did n't have to play mattress tag for your rent . @!Kendall: You did that for me ? @!Chris: No . No , I did it for Ryan . @!Kendall: I was n't going to let him do anything . @!Chris: Please , please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into your act , and I was about to get sick . @!Kendall: You 're wrong about me . @!Chris: You know , the only good thing about Ryan being gone right now is he does n't have to be here to see you crawl . @!Kendall: Forget you ! @!Chris: Start packing . @!Kendall: Hello . Genius , I 'm broke . No one 's going to give me a free ride . What 's this ? @!Chris: That 's a one-way plane ticket back home to Florida , Kendall , and some cash to tide you over until you get some honest work . Now you have no excuse to stay here . All you have to do is get on the plane and never come back . # @!Opal: Well , I do n't know why I would ever expect that old polecat -- @!Erica: Opal , I am sure that Palmer did n't mean -- @!Opal: No , no , listen , I got the message loud and clear . That old goat wants me to scram ? Well , consider me scrammed . @!Erica: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palmer sees you -- @!Joe: No , I 'm really sorry , but Palmer was quite definite about not wanting visitors , especially Opal . @!Erica: Well , he 'll see me , Joe . You wait right here , Opal , because I 'm going to give that old polecat a lesson in gratitude . @!Erica: Palmer , I hope that I 'm not disturbing you . @!Palmer: Well , yes , you are , and I told Joe -- @!Erica: You can tell Joe , you can bark orders at Joe Martin , but Erica Kane takes orders from nobody , including you . @!Palmer: Erica , come here . # @!Liza: I 'm sorry , Stuart . @!Stuart: Here . @!Liza: It 's just that I think that the brain tumor might be back , and if that 's true , then I could be a danger to my daughter . @!Stuart: You could hurt Colby ? No , you could never do that . You love her too much . @!Liza: I love Adam , too , but somehow I took a machete to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just dumb luck he was n't in it at the time . @!Stuart: Why would you do something like that ? @!Liza: I have no idea . I do n't even remember doing it . @!Stuart: Well , maybe you did n't do it . A lot of people would like to slice Adam up . He 's got a lot of enemies . @!Liza: Who raid corporations , not his wardrobe . I think it had to be me . And the way that I 've been acting lately -- @!Stuart: Can I sit down ? @!Liza: Yeah , yeah . @!Stuart: Everybody has a bad day now and then . @!Liza: This is n't just a bad day , Stuart . It 's been going on for weeks . @!Stuart: But to get this upset over a torn shirt -- @!Liza: It 's not just a shirt . It 's a lot of things . I mean , things disappearing , me seeing things and hearing things . I think I hear something , and then I find out later on it 's completely different . @!Stuart: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marian . Yesterday , she asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee , and I thought she was asking me , " Why are you so doppy ? " @!Liza: Do you ever get so angry and you accuse Marian of cheating on you ? @!Stuart: No . @!Liza: You know , I ca n't help but think about that day in the park when I lost Colby and I did n't even remember being with her at the time . @!Stuart: Liza , you were sick then . @!Liza: What if I 'm sick again ? What if it 's worse this time ? What if I 'm a danger to people that I love ? @!Stuart: No , I do n't think that could possibly be true . But no matter what , you do n't have to worry about Colby . @!Liza: I do n't ? Why not ? @!Stuart: Because Adam and Mia love her so much . Even if you did get sick , they 'd take care of her . They 'd keep her safe . # @!Adam: I pay you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is none of your damn business . @!Trey: You 're the boss . @!Adam: Do n't you forget it . @!Colby: Daddy , Daddy ! @!Adam: Ah , Sweetheart . @!Mia: Sorry , Adam . I thought you and Trey were finished . @!Adam: No , just finishing up a few minor details . Well , what 's going on , pumpkin ? @!Colby: Is Mommy still in the hospital ? @!Adam: Oh , yes , she is , but she 'll be home soon . @!Colby: Good , because I miss her . @!Adam: Yeah , I miss her , too . But your Aunt Mia 's here . She can do anything Mommy can . @!Winifred: Excuse me . It is time for Miss Colby 's bath . @!Adam: Okay , you run along with Winifred . Mia and I will be up later . We 'll tuck you in and kiss you good night . @!Colby: I love you , Daddy
