Well , you did n't fall for that farm life , did you ? I should say not . I had to slave for all of them . Was all right till my mother died but I was only a poor relation , you know and they treated me worse than they dared treat a hired girl . Oh , what a life on that farm out in Minnesota . With them Swedes , woman-hungry . One night I was alone in the house and one of the sons came back . After that , I hated them , so I 'd kill them all if I stayed so I ran away . St . Paul .

I never could stand being caged up nowhere . I got good and sick , and they had to send me to the hospital . And it was nice there . I was sorry to leave it , honest . If my old man does n't help me it 's men again . Men all the time . Oh , how I hate them , every mother 's son of them . Do n't you ? Well , there 's good one's and there 's bad one's , you know . Now , your old man , old Chris . Oh , he 's a good one , honest . Well , he 'll have to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , he 's kind of simple . He 's got nutty notions .

Bet you ca n't even hit the net . - Yeah , how about a home run , Babe Ruth ? - Sure , I dare you to . With one throw , I could knock them dames off of their bunks . Go to it , big boy . Do n't overlook me , carrot top . I have the shape that makes the old men young and the young men old . - Attaboy . - Mama wants Papa . - Papa wants Mama . Some mamas too . Now somebody else . Somebody that packs a mean right . What we want this time is a regular he-man . You shut up or I 'll wrap you around the target . Do n't get sore , big boy .

Oh , sure , Anna , you 're crazy about me , and I 'm not after blaming you . You just hate yourself , do n't you , Matt ? Oyster loaf for the lady , sir . - I ordered milk for the lady . - Well , I 've got it here . Well , let 's drink to our good health . Here 's to you . And skoal , Matt , to you and me . - Hot mustard , Matt ? - I do n't need it . - Pepper ? - Full of it . - Well , here 's something you do need . - Oh , is that so , now ? Well , all right . But if I 'm needing sugar , I know where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt . Just like a couple of kids . Sure , Anna , when you 're in love , you ai n't got the brains of a tick . What do you mean , love ? You know what I mean , Anna . It 's in me eye and on the tip of me tongue . A man like me ai n't given to loving a woman . He knows too much about them . Every color of them , from here to the China Sea . The whole lying , cheating smear of them . Sailors ' bait . When he comes across a girl like you , Anna that 's as clean as a shell . You 're a lucky girl to be hearing such talk from the lips of Matt Burke him that the women are so crazy over . Anna , what 's come over you ? Oh , nothing . Sure , do n't lie to me , Anna . You 're as stiff as a corpse . Hello , dearie . - Well , I 'll be ... - Well , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm afraid I do n't remember you . - She do n't remember me . - Of course she do n't , you old scab . - Beat it , or I 'll have you thrown in the brig . - No , Matt , maybe I do know her . That old sea cow ? Go on , clear out of here . You know a nice young girl never met the likes of you . A nice young ... ? A nice young ... Pure and white as a lily . Shut up , or I 'll choke the wind out of your gullet . Oh , Matt , let her alone . She do n't mean nothing by it . Anna . Anna , darling . You see what you 've done ? You frightened her . - Go on , clear out of here . - I 'm going , I 'm going . Let her alone . Do n't go . I was lying , Matt . I know her and she knows me . I recognized her the minute she stepped across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to spill over for nobody . You ai n't responsible for what your old man does . I 'll tell you why she did n't want to talk to me . Because I 'm a tramp , that 's why . And her old man kicked me off the barge when she come there to live on it . Yeah , he did n't want any old wharf rat around a nice young girl . Well , it ai n't so , though , Matt . She 's lying . Lying , I 'm ly ... ? Well , I like your nerve , all right , all right . Gee , I 'm sorry I came here to speak to you . Insulting me . Well , can you beat it ? I 'll be toddling along . I 'm glad you found yourself such a nice , friendly gent . I hope you 're happy , kid . I 'm sorry I bothered you , honest , I ... Oh , forget it , Ann . You only got one life to live . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skipper , you would n't stake me to a quarter , would you ? You know , I have n't had a drink in a month . Take it and beat it . With pleasure , captain . Well , so long . Be a good girl , Ann , no matter how lonesome . Happy days . Happy days . The poor old devil . Sometimes I feel sorry for them . Come on , Anna . Do n't let it get you down . Sure , the world 's full of them . I know it 's a sad sight for a decent young girl the like of yourself , darling . What would you say , Matt , if I told you that ... ? Say what , me darling ? Tell me what . Oh , nothing . Sure , I know what you 'll be wanting to tell me soon , if not this minute that you love me . Do n't be so sure of yourself , Matt . I 'm loving nobody . And you 'll be wanting to marry me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt . You want to marry me ? - Honest ? - Sure , I 'll marry you . Only , do n't be putting me to too many tests , or I might change me mind . I 'm tired , Matt . I wan na go back to the barge . You ... You think you love that sailor fella , Anna ? Well , what if I do ? You think maybe you marry him ? No . I 'm glad you do n't marry sailor , Anna . Is bad for woman . They do n't never see their men only once in long while . You sit and wait all alone and when their boys grow up and go on sea they sit and wait some more . Any girl marry sailor is crazy fool , I tell you . Your mother , she tell you same thing if she was alive . Well , that ai n't why I wo n't marry him . I 'm not thinking about myself but about him . He 's such a simple guy , a big kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . You fool him ? Oh , you go crazy , I think . I 've been thinking I was myself the last few days . I 'll be outside . I love to watch the ships passing . When Matt comes along , tell him where I am , will you ? All right , I tell him . Well , God bless who 's here . How 's the world treating you this afternoon , Anna 's father ? Oh , pretty good , if it ai n't for some fellas . Meaning me , do you ? Well , if you ai n't the funny old crank of a man . Where 's herself ? - Where 's Anna , I 'm after asking you . - She gone out to look on boat . Well , I 'll be going out to her . But before I go , I 'll take this chance while we 're alone to have a word with you . And that word is soon done . I 'm marrying your Anna before this day is out . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or no . That 's easy for saying . You mean I wo n't ? Is it yourself is after stopping me , do you think ? - I stop it if it come to worst . - Sure , it is n't trouble I 'm looking for . You 're her father . Would n't it be a shame for us to be at each others ' throats like a pair of dogs , and I married to Anna . So out with the truth , man alive . What is it you 're holding against me at all ? I do n't want my Anna for got married . Listen , you fella . I 'm old man . I do n't see my Anna for 15 year . She 's all I got in the world . You think now when she come on first trip , I want her for leave me alone again ? Sure , let you not be thinking I 've no heart at all for the way you 'd be feeling . Then you do right thing , eh ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big fella like you on sea , he do n't need a wife . He got new girl in every port , you know that . Oh , shut up . Sure , there 's a time come to every man , on sea or land when he 's sick of the lot of them cows , and wearing his heart out to meet up with some fine , decent girl and building a home to call his own , rearing up children in it . Sure , Anna 's the one woman in the world for me and I ca n't live without her now , I 'm thinking . You think I 'm going let her life be made sorry by you just like her mother 's was made by me ? No , she do n't marry you . Not if I have to kill you first . Glory be to God , what talk from a stumpy runt of a man . It is queer fool 's blather you have , about the sea done this and the sea done that . You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sailor . I 'm hearing a lot from you , and a lot more that Anna tells me you do be saying to her . I 'm thinking it is a poor weak thing you are . Not a man at all . You see if I 'm man maybe quicker than you think . You know the truth in your heart . The sea hit you a clout once and knocked you down . You 're not man enough to get up for another , but you lie there howling murder . I 'd like to see you in the best of your youth . - Do what I done in the storm and after . - Why , you young fool , you . In old days , when I was on windjammer I went through hundred storms worse than that . Ships were ships then , and men what sailing them real men . What you got on steamers now ? You got fellas on deck do n't know a ship from a mud scow and below deck , you got fellas just know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon ashore , you . Is it throwing insults at the men in the stokehold you are , you old ape ? One of them is worth any 10 squareheads ever shipped on a windbag . - You Irish swine . - So you do n't like the Irish , you old baboon ? Sure , it 's that you 're needing in your family . An Irishman . A man of the stokehold to put guts in it so you 'll not be rearing up grandchildren to be jackasses like yourself . Sure , old men getting childish should n't play with knives . Faith , I 've half a mind to hit you a clout will put sense in your square head . Keep away from me , now . Hello , Matt . Are you here already ? Say , what 's up ? How did that chair get knocked over ? Oh , Matt , you have n't been fighting with him , after you promised ? I 've not laid a hand on him , Anna . I told him to his teeth I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it . He tell same thing to girl in every port he goes . I know it 's true , Matt . Do n't you mind what he says . God bless you . And then I said I thought maybe you 'd have a bit of love for me too . So you told him that ? Maybe I have . I 've been wondering if I do love you . I did n't want to , I must own up to that . But I ... I guess I ca n't help it , so I guess I do . Oh , sure , I do , Matt . What 's the use of kidding myself different ? - Sure , I love you . - God be praised . And I have n't ever loved a man in my life before , never . Faith , we 'll be having a grand , beautiful life together to the end of our days . Matt . - Goodbye , Matt . - Goodbye , is it ? I 'll be coming at you in a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man when you 're beat fair and square . Here 's me hand to you . We 'll be friends from this out . No , I do n't shake hands with you , fella . Not while I live . The back of me hand to you , then , if that suits you . It 's a rotten bad loser you are , devil mend you . No , I do n't lose . Anna said she like you little bit . But you do n't hear her say she marry you , I bet . No , and I do n't hear her say the sun is shining , either . - No , I did n't say it , Matt . - There , you hear ? You 're waiting to be asked , you mean ? Well , I 'm asking you now . We 'll be wedded this day , with the help of God . - You heard what I said after I kissed you . - I do n't remember . I said goodbye . That kiss was for goodbye , Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . We 've said goodbye , that 's all . - I knew that was so . - Is it making game of me you 'd be ? It 's a queer time to joke with me . Do n't be doing it , for the love of God . You do n't think I 'd kid you now . I 'm not joking , Matt . I mean what I say . You do n't . You ca n't . It is mad you are , I 'm telling you . - No , I 'm not . - What 's come over you so sudden ? You were saying you love me . I 'll say that as often as you want me to . It 's true . But why ? What ? What is it ? Because it 's the best way I can figure out , Matt . I 've been thinking it over and thinking it over , day and night , all week . Oh , do n't think it is n't hard on me too , Matt . Well , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of us has love ? I 'm thinking it 's listening to that old fool you are him hating me , filling your ears full of lies against me . Yes , Anna believe me , not you . She know her old father do n't lie like you . You sit down , do you hear ? Why do you come butting in and making things worse ? You 're like a devil , you are . Here I was , beginning to like you , beginning to forget all the things I 've held up against you . - You ai n't got nothing for hold against me . Have n't I , though ? Well , let me tell you . Matt , I 'm surprised at you . - You did n't think anything he 'd said ... - Sure , what else would it be ? Tell me , and do n't keep me waiting . I ca n't tell you , and I wo n't . I 've got a good reason , that 's all you need to know . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . So for heaven 's sake , let 's talk of something else . No , I 'll not . - Is it married to someone else you are ? - I should say not . You 're like them women ca n't make up their minds till they 're drove to it . Well , I 'll make up your mind for you . We 've had enough talk . Let 's go to the other room and dress in your best . We 're going ashore . - She do n't do that . - Where do you get that stuff ? Never mind , get on with your dressing . - We 'll see who 'll win in the end , me or you . - Stay , Anna . She will not . She 'll do what I say . You 've had your hold on her long enough . - It 's my turn now . - Your turn ? What am I anyway ? Never mind what you are . It 's what you 're gon na be : Wedded to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do one thing he say ! - She will ! - I 'm her father . - She will in spite of you . She 's taking my orders from now on , not yours . Orders is good . Never mind now . We 've no time to be wasting . - Do you hear what I 'm telling you ? - No , stay here , Anna ! You can go to blazes , both of you . You 'd think I was a piece of furniture . I 'll show you . Sit down . Sit down , do you hear ? Let me talk for a minute . You 're all wrong , see ? I 'm gon na tell you two something , and then I 'm gon na beat it . I 've been meaning to turn it loose on you every time you get my goat with your crazy talk about wanting to keep me safe inland . I was n't going to tell you , but you 've forced me into it . Oh , what 's the use ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way as any other . Do n't forget what you said about it not mattering to you what reason I got as long as I was n't married already . That 's me word , and I 'll stick to it . You make me laugh , honest . Wan na bet you will ? You wait and see . You was going on as if one of you had to own me . But nobody owns me , see , excepting myself . I 'll do what I please . And no man , I do n't give a darn who he is can tell me what to do . I ai n't asking either of you for a living . I 'll make it myself , one way or another . I am my own boss . Now , put that in your pipe and smoke it . - You and your orders . - I was n't meaning it that way at all and well you know it . You 've no call to raise this rumpus with me . - It is him , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you , you did mean it that way . You sounded just like all the rest . It is queer , rough talk , that , for a decent girl the like of yourself . Decent . Who told you I was ? I 'm talking to you now . I do n't want to hear . You go out your head , I think . Well , living with you is enough to drive anyone off their nut . Your bunk about the farm being so fine . Did n't I write you , year after year , how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made out of me ? What did you care ? Nothing . Not even enough to come out and see me . Your crazy stuff about wanting to keep me away from the sea do n't go down with me . You just did n't want to be bothered with me . - Oh , that ai n't so , Anna . - But one thing I never wrote you it was one of them cousins that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was none of my fault . I hated him and he knew it . But he was big and strong , like you . That 's why I ran away from the farm . That 's what made me get a job as a nurse girl in St . Paul . You think that was a nice job for a girl , too , do n't you ? With all them nice inland fellas just looking for a chance to marry me . They were n't looking for marrying . You do n't say nothing . Either one of you . But I know what you 're thinking . You 're just like all the rest . And who 's to blame for it ? Me or you ? If you 'd been a regular father and had me with you things would 've been different . - Do n't talk that way . - I go crazy . I wo n't listen to you . - You will listen . You , keeping me safe inland . I was no nurse girl the last two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house , that 's what . Yes , that kind of a house . The kind that sailors like Matt and you go to in port and your nice inland men too . And all men . I hate them , I hate them ... - Oh , it 's a lie , Anna , it 's a lie ... - So that 's what 's in it . I suppose you remember your promise . No other reason was to count with you as long as I was n't married already . You want me to get dressed and go ashore , do n't you ? Oh , yes , you do . I suppose if I tried to tell you that I was n't that no more you 'd believe me , would n't you ? And if I told you that just getting out on this barge and being on the sea had changed me and made me feel different about things as if all that I 've been through was n't me , did n't count it was just like it never happened you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , I 'm sure , if I told you that meeting you that funny way that night in the fog and afterwards , seeing that you were straight good stuck on me had got me to thinking for the first time in my life . And I sized you up as different from the one's on land , as water is from mud . I could n't marry you with you believing a lie . And I was ashamed to tell you the truth . And now , give me a bawling-out and beat it like I can tell you 're going to . Will you believe it if I tell you that loving you has made me clean ? It 's straight goods , honest . Oh , yes , you will . You 're just like all the rest . The rest , is it ? My curse on you . Clean , is it ? Oh , do n't , Matt . Get out of here . Let me alone . Get out of here ! I 'll be going . And I 'll be drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours off me lips ! And I 'd be getting dead , rotten drunk so I 'll not remember you at all ! I 'll ship away on a boat to the end of the world , where I 'll never see your face again ! - Oh , do n't go . It 's better Anna marry you ... - Let go of me , you old ape ! Marry her , is it ? I 'd see her dead at me feet first . I 'm shipping away out of this , I 'm telling you . My curse on you , and the curse of all the saints . - I go ashore too . - Not after him , I tell you . Do n't you dare . Oh , I go for get drink . I 'm driving you to drink too , huh ? You wan na get drunk so you can forget , like him . Aye . You think I like hear them things ? Oh , Anna . Anna , I think you was n't that kind of girl . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't want me here disgracing you , I suppose . Oh , no , no , Anna . You stay here . It ai n't your fault , I know that . It 's that old devil do this to me . It was all right on barge , with just you and me . Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog . That fella , he do n't never come , you do n't never tell me them things . I do n't never know . Then everything is all right . Oh , that dirty devil sea . Oh , what 's the use ? Go ashore and get drunk . You wait here , Anna ? Maybe . Maybe not . Maybe I 'll get drunk too . Maybe I 'll ... 0h , what do you care what I do ? Go on and beat it . It 's foggy outside . Oh , God . - What 's the trouble ? Feeling sick ? - Inside my head feels sick . Oh , Anna , you think maybe sometime you forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Oh , Anna lilla . Oh , do n't bawl about it . There ai n't nothing to forgive anyway . It ai n't your fault , it ai n't mine . It ai n't his , neither . I fix everything all right for you and me , Anna . Yes ? Then you and me will stick together ? We 'll work for each other and help each other , huh ? - What is it you fixed ? - Well , I sign on steamer Londonderry . Sail for Cape Town tomorrow . Oh , Anna , I only bring you bad luck . That 's how you fix me , is it ? Well , I think that old devil get me back maybe she leave you alone , then . Oh , ca n't you see that you 're doing the same thing that you 've always done ? Ca n't you see that ? Oh , what 's the use of talking ? You ai n't right . I 'll never blame you anymore . Oh , Anna . You forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame . You 're just what you are , like me . And you , you let me kiss you once again , eh ? - Oh , sure , no hard feelings . - Oh , Anna lilla . I ca n't say it , Anna . I think I go lie down , go to sleep . Oh , that booze , he do n't go well , Anna . I think I 'm never going to drink again . I ca n't stand this much longer . What am I waiting for , anyhow , like a darn fool ? Anna ? - Anna ? - Yes , what do you want ? Do n't say it . I know what 's in your mind . Yes , that 's what I was , and that 's what I 'm going back to . I 'd kill you first . And finish it up . It 's a dog 's life I been living since I found out what you are . Oh , why do n't you leave me alone . Go away . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep kicking me for ? Do n't you deserve the worst I 'd say , God forgive you ? All right , maybe I do . But do n't rub it in . Why have n't you done what you said you were going to ? Ship away to the other side of the earth , where you do n't have to see me . - I have . - What ? You 're going away , honest ? I signed on , drunk as I was , and she 's sailing tomorrow . - Where is she going ? Far away ? - Cape Town . It is at the end of Africa . That 's far for you . - What 's the boat 's name ? - The Londonderry . The Londonderry ? Oh , this is too much . Faith , I do n't blame you for laughing at me . True , it is the fool of the world I am to come back to talk to you at all . Oh , what 's the use ? What 's the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna ... Anna , if I could only be believing I was the only man in the world ever you had love for , I could be forgetting the rest , maybe . Are you trying to accuse me of being in love really in love , with them ? You fool , you . I 've stood enough from you . Love them , is it ? I hated them , I tell you . And may God strike me dead , and my mother too , if she was alive if I 'm not telling you the honest truth . Oh , sure , Anna , if I could only be believing you , now . Why , Matt , you 've got to believe it . What can I do ? What will I do to prove to you I 'm not lying ? Anna , would you ... ? Would you be willing to swear an oath , a terrible , fearful oath ? Oh , sure , I will , Matt , on anything . Would you swear on this ? Oh , sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me by me mother , God rest her soul . And I 'm telling you , it has great power in it . And I 'm warning you now , if you swear on this it is me old woman herself who 'd be looking down on you from heaven and praying the saints to put a curse on you if she hears you swear a lie . I would n't have the nerve , honest , Matt , if it was a lie . But it 's the truth , and I ai n't scared to swear it . Give it to me . What do you want me to swear ? You say it . Swear I 'm the only man in the world ever you felt love for . I swear it . I swear it by God . And may the blackest curse of God strike you if you 're lying . And may the blackest curse of God strike me if I 'm lying . Oh , glory be to God , I 'm after believing you now . - Now what 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , why ? - Oh , God pity me . Sure , it 's some devil 's treachery in it . You swearing on a Catholic cross , and you one of the others . - Well , do n't you believe me , Matt ? - Oh , but if it ai n't a Catholic you are ... I ai n't nothing , Matt . What 's the difference ? Did n't you hear me swear ? I 'm afraid I love you , God forgive me , no matter what you are . I 'd be going mad if I 'd not be having you . I 'd be killing the world . We 'll be wedded this day . And we 'll be happy , the two of us , in spite of the devil . Well , we got ta have a drink on this , my good man . - Blast you . - That 's the way to talk . Oh , Matt , it 's time for you two to kiss and make up . You 'll be shipmates on the Londonderry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Aye , and I 'm boatswain on her . The devil ! You 'd be shipping away to sea and leaving her alone again , will you ? It 's all right , Matt . That 's where he belongs , and I want him to go . You 've got ta go too . We 'll need the money . And as for me being alone , why , that runs in the family and I 'll get used to it . I 'll get a house somewhere and I 'll make a regular place for you two to come back . And now you 'll drink and be friends , huh ? Sure . - Here 's luck to you . - Skoal . Well , you 'll not be lonesome long . I 'll see to that , God willing . Sure as himself will be having a grandchild riding his foot , I tell you . - Maybe twins . - Oh , quit your kidding . Is it any religion at all you have , you and your Anna ? Well , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? Oh , then I 'm damned entirely . Oh , well , what 's the difference ? It is God 's will anyhow . It 's queer , you and me shipping on same boat that way . That ai n't right . It 's that funny way old devil sea do her worst dirty tricks . Aye , is so . Faith , I 'm afraid you 've the right of it for once , devil take you . Why , gee , Matt , you ai n't agreeing with him , are you ? Come on . Here 's to the sea , no matter what . Be a game sport , man . Drink to that . Fog , fog all time .

Who did this terrible thing ? Take your seats . I 'm going to find out who did this . I would hate to think that one of my little girls would do such a thing . Do n't look at me , teacher .

Go to the kitchen where you belong . Do n't drop that jam on the floor . Go on . Pa ! Stop it ! You 've whipped him enough ! He did n't mean to be bad .

Of course , this is a tremendous surprise for everybody . We 've only been expecting this since you were about that high . Isabelle , I wish you both ... the best of everything . Isabelle , you 're getting a mighty fine boy . I know it . Johnny . When do you and Isabelle intend to get married ? Well ... We 'd like to get married as soon as we could . - But probably not until spring anyway . - No , do n't you put it off on my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get along alright . About time anyway we stop living off of you . You know that ... government job that was promised to me ? Well , I got tired of waiting for it . I 've lined up something else . Gon na pay me plenty of money too . That 's great ! What is it , Pa ? I do n't want to talk about it yet . I always say : deliver the goods first , talk afterwards . Right ? Right . The happiest moment in a woman 's life is when she feels for the first time her baby 's arms around her neck . No word 's fine enough to describe it ! And the pride and happiness to see him grow up .

Now children , I know you 're cold after you arrived . And if you come in here with me , we may find something to warm me up . Of course it ai n't New York , but it 's good . Women and children first ! Ben , he 's just got a natural sense of humour . - I 'm so disappointed Phyllis could n't come . - She sends you her love , Ma .

That tells the story . - You old ... - Thanks for the booze . - They do n't call in that . - You mean you find it out soon enough . Ca n't something be done about this before it 's too late . Everybody makes mistakes , that 's why the train stops at Reno . Do n't say that . It may turn out alright . Pa should have had a circus . His family is full of clowns .

Keep your eyes open and your trap shut . Make it snappy . Listen , Shelby . You turn off the road at Angus ' place , take the short cut to Cedars . And when you get to the garage , go in the back way , Mac will be waiting there for you . - Did you get that ? - Yes . I 'll be in in just a minute , mother dear .

You mind your own business . Go on ! Pa , you ca n't get away with a thing like this . You must be crazy ! Pa , I 'm ashamed of you . This will kill Ma . Now , come on , Pa . Let 's leave the car here and go home . Johnny , we could n't do that . The stuff is here and they 'll trace the car to the house . Now go on . Alright , Pa , I 'll unload the stuff . You go on home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anything to happen to you . - That 's alright , go on home . - I did n't want to do this . - Go on ! - Did you find anything ? - No . Those shots came from the big car . That big car was a decoy , it let the little car get away . - What 's that ? - Wait a minute . Merry Christmas , Ma ! Merry Christmas , children . Did you sleep well ? Great . That smells good . No , you need n't bother at all . Everything 's all ready . Where 's a fellow wash his face around here ? Ben !

Hurry and get yourself ready for breakfast . Alright , Ma . Isaac and Minnie are coming and bringing the children , so we 're all having breakfast together .

I hope it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? - Pa , what is it ? - It 's Johnny . - Johnny ? What 's happened to him ? - He is n't hurt ! - He 's in jail . Jail ? - Isaac , you 're fooling ! - What for ? What did he do ? The police caught him with his car full of liquor . I do n't believe you ! I ca n't believe you ! My Johnny is in his room ! - I 'll show you . - I 'll go , Ma . In the attic bedroom . He 's brought disgrace upon us . Having liquor in your car is no disgrace . It 's only a small fine . It is n't even serious . An officer was shot ! That 's serious , is n't it ? Isaac , no ! My Johnny would n't hurt anyone . - Ma ! Ma ! - Yes ? Ma , he 's not upstairs ! And his bed has n't been slept in . Pa ! Pa ! Did you hear ? Johnny 's been arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something ? - Why do n't you do something ? - Ma ! Ma ! - You 've got to take it easy . - Johnny ! - Tommy , how much money you 've got ? - None , to speak of . It 's gon na take a lot of money to bail him out of a charge like that . - How about you , Isaac ? - Be sure , your sins will find you out . Now , you let us help . Listen , everything 's going to be alright . - She 's fainted . - Give her a glass of water . Are you alright , Ma ? Are you alright ? Ca n't you see ? There is n't anything I can do about it . But Johnny , you 're not trying to do a thing . Why do n't you talk to the lawyer ? - I have n't anything to say to him . - Johnny , you 're shielding someone . - You 're crazy . - I ca n't understand it . Did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay for it , did it ? I 'll take it back . - I 'm sorry about that . - It does n't matter . Sitting on top of the world ... It sounds sort of foolish now , does n't it ? Johnny , I do n't believe you did it ! I wo n't believe it ! They caught me with the goods . There 's no doubt about that . Of course , it would n't have been so bad , only they took the car and do n't belong to me . Fine chance I 'd have with that company now . Or any other company . Listen . Do n't you gamble your future on me . Do n't wait . There 're plenty of other boys in this town with good jobs . They could be crazy about you . I do n't want you to come here again . I do n't want to see you . Johnny . Johnny . Good morning , Pa . Well , they 've done it . They 've convicted him . Three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've got to do something . We 've got to ! We ca n't do anything now . Johnny should have thought of that before he comitted the crime . - We 've got to help him . - He never listened to me . I could n't tell him anything . I always say : " As ye sow , so shall ye reap " . You can keep them old bars . I do n't want them where I 'm going . You keep them old dice too . You all ai n't got enough juice around here . Where they 're gon na take me , they 're gon na make some electricity experiments on me . Hi , young fellow , let 's go . I 'll stay with Ma Shelby . Can I talk to my boy ? Just for a minute . Make it snappy . Johnny . Johnny . Pa , pull yourself together . You ca n't go on like this . I 've got to , it 's killing me . I ca n't eat , I ca n't sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame for me . - I 'm gon na tell the truth . - Pa , you promised ! You 've got to think of Ma , and the other kids . Come on , Pa . Cheer up ! This little time I 'll be away wo n't mean a thing . I 'll be back before you know it . Johnny . Pa , does the noise of the machine bother you ? No , Ma ... no . Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Here I am . You had a nice , long sleep . Where is Ma ? She 's gone to visit Johnny . She should be back soon . I 've heard the train coming just a little while ago . Isabelle , you do n't believe Johnny is guilty , do you ? I know he is n't . You 'll always love him , stand by him , wo n't you ? Always . Isabelle , tell Ma ... When she comes ... I want to see her . Something I 've ... got to tell her . Yes , dear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be hungry . You 're alright . Ma Shelby , you must have walked very fast . Isabelle , I have so much to tell you . - How is Johnny ? - Honestly , that boy gets better looking everytime I see him . Did he ask you about me ? Well , now , let me see ... - I think he said something ... - Ma Shelby , tell me . He sends you ... - How is Pa ? - He had a long rest . He 's asked about you several times . He wants to see you . And I have so much to tell him all about Johnny . Pa ! Isabelle ! I manage to keep busy . Sometimes it 's awfully hard to realize that Pa 's gone . Poor Pa . The only luck he ever had ... was bad . He was so good and kind . If I had my life to live over , I 'd marry the same dear man . Of course you would . Ma , why do n't you go and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I could n't bring myself to give up the old home . I do n't mind working , I like it . Besides , it 's good for me . You 're swell . How is Isabelle ? That girl is prettier everyday I see her . Do you know she and her Ma beg me to come to live with them till you come home ? Why do n't you ? I could n't do that . As much as I love them ... - Johnny ? - The kid himself . - How did you get out so soon ? - Good behaviour . Why did n't you let me know ? I 'd have waited at jail all night . That 's just why I did n't let you know . Besides , I thought it would be kind of nice to surprise you . Where are you going , Ma ? I must tell Isabelle , she 'd never forgive me . Come here ! I telephoned her , she knows I 'm home . Let me set this pillow for you . Ma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Can I get you another cup of coffee ? - I 'm full right up to here . I 've never eaten so much in my life . I was so hungry I thought I had hollow legs . Johnny , I have n't laughed so since ... That sounds sort of encouraging . Wait a minute , sweetheart . Here , take it easy . What 's the matter , honey ? Did I say something ? - Of course not , Johnny . - But you 're crying . I ca n't help it . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . Johnny , you have n't changed a bit . - No fooling ? - No fooling . You know , now stop me if I 'm wrong , but I 've got a hunch that you two are sort of glad to see me . Now once more . I must fix your room . Wait a minute , Ma . You ca n't run out on us like that . Can she , Isabelle ? - I should say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you two must have a lot to talk about . Johnny , I left the rest of that apple pie in the cupboard . In case ! Really I ought to be going home . Isabelle , ca n't you stay all night ? Would your Ma care ? - I told her that I might . - Why do n't you say that in the first place ? - Do n't ask so many questions . - Come here . Now that 's all settled . I want you to listen to a little straight talk . Johnny , you home ! Listen , honey , I 've got some great plans . I 've been promised a job out in Seattle , and my railroad fare too . Looks like a great chance . It wo n't be any time at all before I 'll be able to send for you and Ma . - Johnny , why your mother ... - I know . That 's the tough part of it . I do n't know how to tell her . - Why ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere else , start over . When I got off the train and walked up the street , everybody looked the other way . Fellows I used to go to school with ducked in the stores , so they would n't have to meet me . And when I came to the gate , some kids hollered " Jailbird " . Johnny , you must n't go . Do n't you see ? I ca n't stay here . I 'm no millionaire . And my own family , think about . Ma 's getting old , Isaac . That 's the tough part of it . Of course , I have n't made things any too easy for her . You have n't made the things too easy for any of us . It 's been like a black cloud hanging over the whole family . I know that . As soon as I get out there , I 'll send money for her every month . I 'll send it to you , Isaac , so that you can see that she gets the things she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the money . Answer the door for me , will you , honey ? No , you answer it yourself . My mother . The great event , it shall come to pass . - How do you do ? - Phyllis . Phyllis , darling , come here . Mother , this is Phyllis . How do you do ? - Is n't this a surprise ? - Yes . - Mother , take off your things . - You do . Come in here . Why did n't you let us know you were coming ? We 'd have met you at the train . Isaac thought it would be nice to surprise you . Isaac 's been so worried about me , he thought it 's best to close up the old home . What ? - He said it was so expensive . - Did he say that ? Well , it was awfully lonesome living there all alone . But he took all our furniture to his home to keep for us . Gosh , it 's good to see you , Ma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a home here with us just as long as you want it . Then , you go upstairs , to my place . All right . Goodbye .

Oh , Daddy , I had a dream last night . I dreamed Mommy and you were putting me to bed . And do you remember how you used to tell me fairy tales ? - Come on , honey child . - First Mother-What is it , Uncle Billy ? What 's the matter , Uncle Billy ? Why does everybody act so funny ? Is something wrong ? No , honey child . There is something wrong . Is it about my mommy ? Daddy , what is it ? Did something happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's how you must always think of it- that Mama 'll never be ill again ... or frightened or discouraged . She 'll never suffer anymore .

There has n't been a Yankee patrol through here since morning . There 's bound to be one soon . Get Miss Virgie 's things ready . - You mean , you 're gon na take Miss Virgie with you , Massa Cary ? - Yes . - Through the Yankee line ? - I 've got to get her to my sister in Richmond . - But , Captain , it 's dangerous . You ca n't do it , sir . - Yankees , Daddy ! All of you go back to your cabins , but do n't hurry . Rosabelle , you go with them and see that they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch . - Yes , sir . - Come , honey . - Do n't talk now . Well , I did n't know- I did n't know that hole was there . Honey , do you remember how Mama always taught you never to tell a lie ? - Oh , I never have , Daddy . - I know , and Mama 's proud of you for it . But if those Yankees should come in here , you 've got to tell them a lie . - You want me to tell a lie ? - Just this once , honey , for Daddy 's sake . And in a case like this , it really is n't a lie . If they should stop here and they ask you ... tell them I was here but I left an hour ago , and you saw me cross the river . Now be a brave little Confederate , darling . Do this for me . - Daddy . - Hmm ? - Would General Lee want me to tell that lie ? - Yes , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a whopper . They 's comin ' , Massa Cary ! Here , help me with this . Do n't be frightened . Act as though you did n't know they were here . All right , Massa Cary . Put that table back up against the wall . Remember now , act as though nothing had occurred . Dance or play or something . We will , Daddy . - What you all doin ' ? - You got your mouth organ ? - Yeah . - Well , get ready to use it . Sergeant , take your men and search that wood . Cary 's around here , and this time we 've got to get him . He 's given us the slip long enough . - Hurry now . Move fast . - Yes , sir . All right , men , let 's go . Well , that was quite a concert . And how is the littlest rebel of them all ? Fine , Yankee.Just fine . Do you mind if I warm my hands at your fire ? No , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . Yes , sir . My daddy was here , but he left an hour ago . - Is that so ? - Yes , sir . He was here .. . but he left an hour ago , and I saw him cross the river . Well , now , that 's very interesting . I know another dance . Oh , yes , sir . She know a lot of dances . Now , dance for the gentlemen , honey child . What was your father doing here ? My mommy was very sick , and she kept asking for Daddy . So yesterday Uncle Billy brought him ... and this morning my mommy went away . - Is that true ? - Yes , sir . I 'm sorry . But my daddy says I must always think of it as beautiful . Your daddy 's right . You see , I have a little girl , too , just about your age ... and I 'd feel awful sorry if her mommy went away . - Has your little girl got a pony ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat and everything ? You had the table out in the center of the room , eh ? - No , sir . - No , sir . - What are those tracks ? - I made them with my foot . Is that a trapdoor in the ceiling there ? No , sir . There ai n't nothing up there . Nothing at all , sir . - You 've been lying to me . - No , sir , I haven't . - Your father 's here now ! - No , sir , he is n't ! - You know he is ! - He was here , but he left an hour ago . - I saw him cross the river . - You tell me the truth , or I 'll give you the worst-- Just a minute ! - Drop your pistol . Now , come down and keep your hands up . Back over against that door . Turn around and keep those hands up . Daddy . All right , you can drop them now , but no funny business . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I ? Yes , you did , darling . Daddy 's proud of you . I said just what you told me to . You were perfect , and I was only fooling about the whipping . I really was n't going to . Run outside , darling . Daddy 'll call you . Come on , Uncle Billy . Can you arrange so that my arrest wo n't frighten her ? - I 'll try . - Thanks . - Any papers on you ? - No , I 'm not scouting this trip , Colonel . I came home to bury my dead ... and take my little girl to Richmond , where my sister is . I see . Well , come on . Let 's get it over with . I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to- to bid my little girl good-bye . I understand . Will you tell her I 've gone back to General Lee ? I 'll return soon . - Yes , it would just about fit . - What ? - The Yankee uniform . - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Well . I left a uniform there to be mended by the slaves . If you stole that uniform , I do n't know how I could stop you . - You mean-- If you were wearing a Union uniform ... and had a pass through the lines ... you 'd stand a mighty good chance of making Richmond . - Where would I get a pass ? - From me . I do n't think my country expects me to make war on babies . I do n't know what to say . Of course , you realize what it means if you 're caught in my uniform . Are n't you taking an awful chance yourself , Colonel ? War 's full of chances . I wo n't forget this . I hope you get through . - God bless you . - There 's just one thing I ask . In passing through our lines , whatever you see or hear , forget . My word of honor . Daddy , Daddy ! The soldiers are coming back ! Get out the back way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Yankee man gon na be nice ? A man could n't be nicer than he 's been . You see , you 've made me think of my little girl . - I knew all the time you were n't gon na whip me . - Come on . We 've got to hurry . Good luck . You 're nice enough to be a Confederate . Good-bye , Uncle Billy . - Any sign of him ? - Not a thing , Colonel . Well , you men better come in and warm up . There 's a fire in here . Yes , sir . - No trace at all , eh ? - No . But I 'm sure he 's still around here . They buried his wife just an hour ago . Look ! There goes somebody . - A man and a child ? - Yes . They 're headed for the woods . That 's a slave and his pickaninny . They just left here . They 're all right . - Do you hear anything ? - Horses . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man give you a paper to show them , Daddy ? Yes , but the Yanks around here may recognize me . I do n't want to use the pass until we get out of this neighborhood . This is n't a good neighborhood anyway . No . Come on . - Halt ! - Whoa ! - Where are you going , sir ? - I 'm taking this child to her father just beyond our lines . Colonel Morrison sent me . Here 's a pass . Have you got a little girl , mister ? No , I 've got a boy . - Where 'd you come from ? - Cary 's plantation . Left there at noon . - Why are n't you using the main road ? - Full of artillery .

I do n't know why it is n't a sin to do any of the things we do in war . What 's the 72nd Vermont ? Well , that 's a regiment of soldiers I have no intention of meeting . Halt ! Colonel Morrison asked me to take this child to Greensburg . - Here 's his pass . - Colonel Morrison ? - Yes . - Where was he ? Cary plantation , about 1 8 miles south of_here . - When did you leave there ? - Why-- We left there at 1 2:00 . - Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I 'm six years old .

Do n't you remember the shoe polish ? - No ! - Well , I do . Her old man 's the most dangerous scout in the rebel army . This looks mighty funny to me . Go get ' em ! Hurry up ! Head ' em off ! Take the lower road ! Get under the seat quick , honey . Halt ! Keep your hands up . Are you armed ? - No . - Let 's see . All right , we 'll go back .

You 've been very kind ... especially so in getting Uncle Billy here to look after my little girl . - I appreciate that . - I wish there was something I could really do , Captain . That child has literally captured us all . - Colonel-- Yes , I know . I heard you . No chance at all , eh ? No . And is my little party set for the morning of the 27 th too ? I 'm sorry , Colonel . He 's innocent , Major . All he did was try to help a child . The evidence we could n't overcome , Colonel ... was the fact that you not only gave him a pass but that he was wearing your uniform . - I stole that uniform . - We could n't make them believe that . I had hoped we could . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want done . Thank you , Major . Well , it was a gamble , and we lost . I have no regrets .

Well , the world is full of names . They could have picked out any other name . - Who could ? - Whoever did . - I do n't know who it was . - Man , what are you talkin ' about ? Why is a shoe called a shoe ? Massa Cary says that shows you got brains when you 're thinkin ' ' bout things . I spent all day yesterday thinkin ' , why is a horse called a horse ?

I expects they take him out pretty soon now . Last night when I said my prayers ... I asked God to let Daddy out of there ... and- and I asked him for a new dress too . Then I thought maybe that was too much to ask ... so I told God he did n't have to bother about the dress . - Was that right , Uncle Billy ? - Yes , that was right , honey . But if you want that dress ... I 'll kinda slip a little hint in my prayers tonight . Now , Uncle Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you did yesterday , I 'll never take you again . No , ma'am , I wo n't . We 've got to smile , so Daddy will think we 're happy . I will , honey . You 'll see . You ready now ? Yes , all ready . James Henry , you wait here until we get back . Yes , sir . Did you like it , Daddy ? You have charge of Captain Cary 's little girl , have n't you ? Yes , sir . I is one of his slaves , sir . - I want to speak to you a moment . - Yes , sir . That was lovely , darling . Come on now , and tell me what you 've been doing . Oh , I sewed up a hole in my dress . Mrs .

When she was so nice , and Colonel Morrison 's so nice , and Mrs . Robin ... why do the rest of the people have to kill each other ? I do n't know , honey . We grown-ups have n't as much sense as you children . This is n't money enough , but it 's all I can spare . I 'll give you a letter to him . He may help you . I do n't know . Thank you , sir .

Oh , you switch around , eh ? Well , Daddy said you tried to help us , so I make you my second daddy . Nothing so nice ever happened to me . We got ta hurry , missy . Good-bye , Yankee . Good-bye , rebel darling . Good-bye , Daddy . - God love you , honey . - I 'll come tomorrow . - All right , sweetheart . - Good-bye , Massa Cary . - Good-bye , Billy . - Good-bye , Colonel Morrison , sir . - Bye . - Good-bye , darling . - Good-bye . - Bye .

And how much for the little girl , sir ? Ah , she 's a little too tall for half fare . Oh , no , I 'm not . I 'm standing on my toes . This is my right size . All right . It 'll be $9.60 for you , first class . Thank you , sir . - Have you got enough ? - No , child . It 's gon na take more money than what we got . How do people get money ?

Bless the Lord . Praise the Lord . We got enough now , honey , for railroad fare . Come on , child . - You may go in now . - Thank you , sir . Come on , Uncle Billy . Come right in . Miss Virginia Cary and Uncle Billy ? - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir , Mr . President . How do you do , my dear ? Very nicely . Thank you , sir . And how are you , Uncle Billy ? Let me see .

Thank you kindly , sir . Tell me about it . My daddy went away to the war ... and then the Yankees came around to our house ... and sometimes my daddy came home . - Was he in uniform ? - Yes , sir . - What color ? - Gray . I see . Thank you , sir . Then there were so many Yankees around ... my daddy could n't come home anymore . Then they burnt down our house , and my mommy got sick ... and had to go to bed in Uncle Billy 's cabin . No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . We had nothing to get her medicine with , Mr . President . The soldiers took most everything we had . And Mommy kept asking for my daddy . All the time she 'd ask . No , that 's mine . You had the last piece . - I beg your pardon . - You forgot . That 's all . So Uncle Billy went and brought my daddy back home . The next day , my mommy went away . There , there . Do n't cry . You 're a great big girl . You must n't cry . - I won't . - What happened next ? Then the Yankees came , and my daddy had to hide in the garret . Then Colonel Morrison came in . He talked to me . He 's awfully nice . He has a little girl , too , just my age . Then he found Daddy , and Daddy told him ... about wanting to take me to my Aunt Caroline in Richmond ... so I could get enough to eat . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he could bring Miss Virgie where she could be taken care of . I see . Now , on this trip ... before your daddy was captured ... did he write down anything on paper or anything ? - No , sir . - Did he ever stop and look at the Yankee soldiers ... or count them or look at the cannons ? No , sir . He told me that if we got to Richmond ... and anyone asked me what I had seen ... I was in honor bound not to tell them . - He told you that ? - Yes , sir . Because Colonel Morrison asked him not to see anything ... and my daddy gave his word , and they shook hands . - John . - Yes , Mr . President ? - Mr . President ? - Yes , Miss Virgie . You wo n't let them shoot my daddy and Colonel Morrison , will you ? - Rush this by special courier to General Grant . - Yes , Mr . President . - Is this yours ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece .

You 're playing with dynamite when you start monkeying with those fellows . I could n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George , do n't let him start anything . He might make a bad situation worse . Now , you know your father . Tomorrow we 'll all be on the boat sailing for America . He 'll have plenty of time to cool off . Very odd circumstance . I do n't think there 's anything odd about it , [Charlie] . It 's just unfortunate that your friend met with this accident . Had cable from Major Kent asking me to investigate gambling ring . Accident seem most convenient . [Charlie] , you 've a very suspicious mind . Suspicion often father of truth . Well , at any rate , it 's in your lap . The Oceanic will be docking in a few minutes . You better go down there , see what you can find out . - Sorry about your friend , [Charlie] . - Thank you so much . [Woman_Singing] [Knocking] - Who is it ? - Steward , sir . [Ship_Whistle_Blows] - Were you going ashore , sir ? - No . You 've been cooped up here for 10 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll tone you up . - I 'm all right . Maybe you 'd like to see the doctor , sir ? I 'll get him for you . I do n't want a doctor . If I do , I 'll send for him . Right you are , sir . Marks of violence quite evident , Doctor ? The hoof prints are deeply indented in the skull . The body is still aboard , if you wish to examine it . - All in proper time . - [Ship_Whistle_Blows] So sorry . Not necessary for ladies to remain . You and Alice go to the cabin , hmm ? I 'll join you later . Please , ca n't we get this over with ? - You , uh , major 's secretary ? - I was . Yes . I 'm with Mr . [Chester] now . [Chuckles] Excuse , please . Uh , sometime memory very bad . Who you say find body ? I said it was Mr . Fenton 's stable boy . Thank you so much . You also have horse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string of horses I bought in Australia . You intend racing same ? Yes , but I do n't see what that has to do with it . You say you talk with major ten minutes before death ? - Your memory 's improving , Mr . Chan . - Thank you so much . Ca n't we end this ? Dr . Johnson has made a thorough examination and said it was an accident . This unnecessary questioning is idiotic . Easy to criticize , more difficult to be correct . Will now inspect stall where major meet death . - Permission , please ? - Certainly , Mr . Chan . [Horse_Blusters] Very strange . Avalanche know major four years ... yet kick him to death . - Well , he has a bad temper . - Huh . Friendly now . You wanted to see my stable boy , did n't you ? - Please . - [Horse_Whinnies] Streamline . Streamline ! - Streamline ? - [Monkey_Chatters] Hey , you old Lollipop ! What you all doin ' ? Streamline ! Where are you ? Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Yes , sir . Quit that . What 's the matter with you ? [Monkey_Chatters] Now you all stay up there where you belong and mascot with Gallant Lad . - Yes , sir ? - This gentleman wants to ask you about the accident . He 's a detective . Is you a cop ? My , oh , my ! You remember position of body in stall ? That 's just what I 'm trying to forget . This is stall where honorable major meet death ? Oh , no , sir . It happened over yonder . Yes , after the accident , we moved Avalanche to another stall . Please . Where is Mr . Streamline ? [Groans] Yes , sir ? Here I is . Where was body ? Body ? Back yonder aging the wall lying on his face . Uh , will , uh , kindly take same position on floor ? I was just-Who ? Me ? No , do as he says now . Would greatly appreciate cooperation . Me on floor ? Could I fix him up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Do as he tells you ! - Yes , sir . Somethin ' gon na happen to me , I know . Ai n't no good come from playing dead on the floor . Thank you so much . Please to stay . Yes , sir . Horse in stall always face forward like others ? Yes . Narrow width make impossible to turn around ? That 's rather obvious , is n't it ? Then , Avalanche could only kick backward . That 's the way a horse always kicks . Thank you . - Something very strange here . - You mean me ? Now , what 's strange , Mr . Chan ? Animal kick backward , body lie there ... yet bloodstains found here . Observe , please . Shape like exclamation marks lying down ... with pointed ends toward rear of stall . Is there anything unusual about that ? Yes , very poor attempt at deception . - May borrow fountain pen ? - Certainly . Thank you . [Chatters] - [Chattering_Continues] - [Avalanche_Whinnies] Will now demonstrate only manner in which bloodstains could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what does that get you , Mr . Chan ? Idea that maybe someone stand here ... and while major pet Avalanche ... murderer crush skull with heavy weapon ... then drag body to back of stall to put blame on noble animal . This is fantastic and absurd ! There was blood on the horse 's hoofs and my examination indicated the man was- [Screeching] Why , that 's Avalanche ! [Screeching_Continues] - [Whinnies] - It 's that confounded monkey ! Get him off there ! Streamline ! Yes , sir ! Get that monkey down from there before I throw him overboard ! Come here , you Lollipop . [Horse_Whinnies] Do n't you all know better than to pester with Avalanche ? - Have n't I told you to keep that monkey away from Avalanche ? - It 's all right . I 'll give instructions that he be kept tied up for the rest of the voyage . I 'm sorry about this interruption , Mr . Chan ... but you see , Lollipop was brought up with Gallant Lad . And when I bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Perhaps he senses our rivalry , George . There 's your answer . That 's what happened . Major Kent was in the stall , and the monkey frightened Avalanche ... and he kicked the major to death before he could get out . Very excellent analysis . Why , the whole thing is preposterous ! I ca n't have my ship held here for investigation . That runs into thousands of dollars . [Charlie] is usually right when he has a hunch . Have more than hunch . - Now , look here , Mr . Chan-- Excuse , please . Took liberty of borrowing small piece from boat . - [Clanks] - Well , what 's that ? Why , it 's a part of the clutch control of the winch ! Yes , uh , twin to one missing from cargo deck outside horse stalls . Observe . Shape identical with horseshoe blows which crush skull of Major Kent . Very excellent proof of murder . That means the investigation will have to continue , [Captain] . But ca n't Mr . Chan go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , [Charlie] ? Do you want a sea voyage ? - Sea voyage good for health . - [Chuckles] Boat sail at 6:00 ? Your cabin 'll be ready . I 'll pack our bags before you can say , " Jack Robinson , " Pop . Uh , correction , please . You pack my bag . - You stay home with Jack Robinson . - Aw , gee , Pop . [Chuckles] Aloha and good luck . Thank you so much . See you later . - [Band] - [Chattering] Here you are , Mr . Chan . 212 . B Deck . - Thank you so much . - Yes , Father . Hello , Mr . Chan . Well , Mr . Chan , we 've been looking for you . I 'm afraid we treated you rather badly this afternoon . I - I owe you an apology , sir . All forgotten- like last year 's bird 's nest . [Chuckles] Does it occur to you the guilty person may have left ship ? Uh , check on passengers at gangplank reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person we bump into may be the murderer ... - sort of gives a fellow the creeps . - [Chuckles] What 'll be your next move , Mr . Chan ? Make effort to catch murderer . - For you , sir . - Well . Will you pardon me ? Listen to this ! " Do n't enter Avalanche in the Santa Juanita Handicap . A dead horse ca n't win a race . " - May I see that ? - Where 'd you get this , [Bruce] ? What ? Oh , at the- at the desk . Time of delivery stamped on back of envelope ? Yes , it seems to be blurred . Four minutes past 6:00 . That 's only 10 minutes ago . - Uh , may examine , please ? - First they get the major . Now they 're trying to scare me . Look here , George . Whoever wrote this means business ... and Avalanche is too fine a horse to lose through your stubbornness . I 'll give you 20,000 for him and retire him for a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the major was right . I 'm going to see it through to the finish . I 'll talk to [Captain] Blake and insist on an extra guard below . Most excellent precaution . Oh . So sorry . May have letter , please ? - Certainly . - Thank you so much . [Ship's_Whistle_Blows] Oh , gee , Pop . How 'd you know it was me ? Frequent spanking when young make rear view very familiar . Why you here ? Well , after you left , Mom decided to take the kids to visit Aunt Ling ... at the other end of the island , and I thought-Uh , you make suggestion about visit ? I - I sort of mentioned it . But , uh-Cabin boy outfit- disguise ? Oh , no , Pop . This is on the level . I signed for the trip . Now look , Pop , if a gambling ring 's back of this , it 's dangerous ... and , well , gee , I 'd feel terrible if anything happened to you ... and I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is poor who have worthy son . " Thank you so much . Then you 'll let me help ? Examine , please . [Whistles] Say ! The top edge is uneven , like it had been cut off with scissors . Yes . Writer take precaution to eliminate Oceanic trademark ... but forget watermark in paper . They 're the same , all right . Then whoever wrote this is on the boat . And look , Pop . The E 's are clogged up , and the R 's a little above the line . That means if we can find the machine this was written on , we 'll have our man . Why , it 's a cinch ! I can search all the cabins . One moment , please . Search only in pursuit of duty as cabin boy . Must remember obligation to ship . Okay , Pop . I 'll clean every room on the boat if I have to . One thing more . As , uh , humble cabin boy , must forget , " Okay , Pop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secretary . I 'm gon na bet every dollar I have on Avalanche . - Then we 'll get married and-- [Bruce] , please . That is n't the kind of marriage I want . I 'd always hoped the man I 'd marry would stay away from racing and betting . - Why , Alice , I never thought that you-- Do n't you see , darling ? That 's the sort of thing I 've had all my life . Dad and I never had a real home . It was always just one track after another . But the thrill of racing- the gamble and then winning . And losing . We never felt sure of anything . One minute Dad would be on top of the world ... and the next , we 'd have to borrow money to pay the feed bill . [Bruce] , dear , I 'd hate to go through that with you . All right , dear . Santa Juanita will be the last time . I promise . Beg pardon , sir . The gentleman in 219 wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , darling . I 'll see you in the lounge . [Locking_Door] - [With_Accent] Oh ! So " solly . " - Hear , hear . Not so fast . - You 're a new boy , are n't you ? - New now . " Velly " soon old . Ah , smart , eh ? You do n't belong up here . - And what were you doing in that cabin ? - Finish downstair . Think " velly " smart work hard . By and by " catchee " more money . Yeah ? You 'll catch more than that if I find you up here again . Now , scat ! Scat chop-chop . Typing , Faint - What are you doing here ? - Oh ! Oh . [With_Accent] Excuse , please . Write letter to girlfriend . Hereafter , write your letters somewhere else . So " solly " you mad . Clean up now , chop-chop . So " solly . " So " solly . " So " solly . " - Oh , so " solly . " - Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to stay off this deck . Oh , tell him I went bottom side , Pop . I 'm awfully sorry , sir . Did I hurt you ? [Sighs] Stoop to pick up pin . Bring good luck . Good luck to that moon-faced cabin boy . He 's a very suspicious character , he is . And as soon as I get me hands on him , into the brig he goes . Did you notice which way he went , sir ? Uh , make hasty exit to north . Right you are , sir . I 'll get him . Psst ! Pop ! I found the typewriter all right . It belongs to Mr . Fenton . See ? The letters are exactly the same . Most excellent progress . Well , I guess that 's that . All we 've got to do now is arrest him . Hasty conclusion like toy balloon- Easy blow up , easy pop . Do n't you think Fenton did it ? You find way to typing machine . Maybe someone else do same . Gee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do now , Pop ? Surprise attack often find enemy unprepared . That extra guard ought to be on duty by now . I 'll step down and check . - I wish you wouldn't . - Now , dear , will you please stop worrying ? I 've done nothing but worry , George , ever since you received that note . - I told you not to say anything about it . - I know . I know . You stay here with Warren . I 'll be gone only a few minutes . Ca n't you persuade him to sell Avalanche to you ? Try and make him do it . Any progress ? Long road sometime shortest way to end of journey . - Uh , may borrow cigarette , please ? - Yes , certainly . This was n't in my pocket when we left the dining room . It 's another one of those notes . " A dead horse is n't worth $20,000 . " What does it all mean ? It means that someone knows an awful lot about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Thank you so much . Will make immediate investigation . Did you notice the way he looked at me ? Do you think he could have put that in your pocket ? No , he was n't within a yard of me . The best place for you is in your stateroom . I 'm going down to the stalls and see George right away . [Coughs] - Left at the post ? - [Bruce] 'll be back in a minute . - Alone at last . - Now , Denny , do n't tell me I 'm the only girl you ever loved . If [Bruce] does n't marry you pretty soon , I will tell you . - What 's holding things up ? - Money . He 's so noble . He insists upon waiting ... until he can support me in the manner to which I 've been accustomed . - Very foolish young man . - You mean [Bruce] ? Foolish to seek fortune when real treasure hiding under nose . [Laughs] Will you tell him that for me ? Will be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let a pal down ... you tell [Bruce] to consult me hereafter before he bets on a horse . [Chuckles] Oh , wo n't you sit down , Mr . Chan ? Thank you so much . The same in these , and make mine Scotch . - Yes , sir . - What will you have ? - Uh , sarsaparilla . - Sarsaparilla , sir ? - Please . - Very good , sir . That 's dissipation for you . You are lucky at , uh , horse betting ? I 'll say he is . With all the odds against him ... he bet on Stardust at the Melbourne Cup . - I have good hunches sometimes . - Play hunch on Stardust ? I suppose you could call it that . Look , Mr . Chan . Just as I was coming up the stairs , this fell at my feet . " It 's dangerous to know too much about other people 's business . " - [Bruce] . - Do n't get the jitters . That sounds like the one George received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Bruce] told me about it . Well , what do you make of it , Mr . Chan ? Make conclusion you talk too much . - Well , this is for you , Mr . Barton . - Hmm ? How it came to be on my tray I do n't know . It was not there when I left the bar . Well , I got one too . - They certainly are n't playing any favorites . - [Opens_Envelope] " A smart gambler knows a dead horse ca n't win . " Very interesting . May keep , please ? Will make immediate investigation . I 'd like to do a little investigating on my own hook , if you do n't mind . Cooperation greatly appreciated . Excuse , please . Well , hello , Mr . Chan . Well , this seems to be for me . Yes . " Withdraw Avalanche from the Santa Juanita Handicap . This is your last warning . " - Your secretary and Mr . Barton also receive mysterious notes . - What ? Uh , writer seem very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ? Why do n't you do something about it ? Rabbit run very fast , but sometime turtle win race . Well , they 're after you too . [Chester] What does it say ? Most distressing . Must give immediate attention . Excuse , please . Come back here , you ! @door_opens , Closes Gee , Pop . That steward nearly grabbed me dropping that last note to Mr . [Chester] . Congratulations for most expert delivery of mysterious letters . Did your scheme work all right ? Did you find anything ? Experiment result in most interesting discovery . [Ship_Whistle_Blows] [Man] Trouble in the forward hold ! The forwards stalls . That 's where Avalanche is . Come on , Pop . One moment , please . You remain here . - [Whinnying] - Come on . Get these horses out of here . [All_Shouting] [Shouting_Continues] [Whinnying] - What started this , [Captain] ? - I 'm sure I do n't know , but it 's under control . It 's okay . It 's a lucky thing the fire was discovered in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... - just to carry out a threat against a horse . - Contradiction , please . Person who start fire intend no harm to noble animal . How do you figure that out ? Fire made directly under automatic apparatus ... so heat will set off alarm more quickly before much damage . Their way of letting me know that they could have killed Avalanche if they 'd wanted to . - Where was the extra guard when this happened ? - He was on duty . - May , uh , question him ? - Smithers ! - Yes , sir ? - You were where when alarm sounded ? On the cargo deck , sir . You had instructions to stay in here . Why did you leave ? One of the booms was squeaking , sir , and made Avalanche nervous . When Mr . [Chester] came down , he spoke to Mr . Bagley about it ... - and he told me to fix it . - That 's right . [Captain] Smithers . You also on cargo deck ? No . After Mr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long there before alarm ? About 10 minutes , maybe 15 . I do n't know exactly . - Horses alone then ? - Streamline was here . I told him to keep an eye on them till Smithers got back . Mr . Streamline ? Yes , sir ? - Yes , sir ? - You were present when alarm sounded ? Yes , sir , but- but I was asleep , sir . You see , sir , I took me a drink of gin for the misery in my feet ... and , naturally , I go to sleep when I take a drink of gin . I ought to discharge you ! Next move may be more than warning . - Extreme precaution now necessary . - You 're absolutely right . - From now on , you sleep here , Bagley . You understand ? - That 's a good idea , I guess . - You have your gun with you ? - It 's in my room . [Chester] Well , what good is it doing there ? I thought with this going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I thought with this going on , something might happen , so I was cleaning it . It 's on my table , Streamline . Get it for me , will you ? - It ai n't loaded , is it ? - Of course not . And bring the cartridges . Yes , sir . Excuse , please . What did you find , Mr . Chan ? Ghost of matches . Here are the gun and bullets , Mr . [Chester] . If you ever take another drink on duty , you 're [Man] What happened ? - Mr . Chan ! - What happened , [Captain] ? - Get a doctor . Hurry ! - [Sailor] Yes , sir . - I 'm sorry , Mr . Chan . I do n't know what to say . Happy bullet in leg rather than heart . Thank you so much . I thought you were cleaning the gun . You said it was n't loaded . It was n't when I left my room . - Ten minutes so far . - Hmm . [Knocking] You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May enter . Hello . I hear you ran into a bullet . Contradiction , please . Bullet ran into me . [Chuckles] I 'm so sorry . Really , I am . Sympathy reason for visit ? And to return the mysterious little note that you sent me . Clever idea , Mr . Chan . My compliments . Pleasure to return compliment . Clever deduction . Good . And now that you 've admitted my ability as a detective ... why not let me in on the secret ? - Whom did you expect to catch ? - Maybe you have answer . I wish I had . I liked the old major a great deal . [Nervous_Chuckle] If I can be of any service , just , uh , give me a buzz . - Thank you so much . - [Door_Closes] Do you think he did it , Pop ? Ocean have many fish . There it goes . [Man] who set fire have 12 minutes to cover trail . That 's right . Now look , Pop ... Bagley said he was in his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done it , and so could Mr . [Chester] ... because he was there while the guard was outside . But wait a minute ! It might have been that secretary of his too . Because when I dropped his note , he was coming up from the cargo deck . You know ... I still think that Fenton 's the guy we want . I could have sworn someone was at that window . [Lee] , come back . Gee , Pop , what are you always stopping me for ? Why do n't you give me a chance to clean this case up ? Foolish rooster who stick head in lawn mower end in stew . Look at you , laid up for the rest of the trip with a bullet in your leg . I 'm not gon na let them get away with that . I 'm gon na find the guy that loaded that gun ! Oh , so it 's you , eh ? What 's he doing here , sir ? Is he annoying you ? - Very desperate character . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? [Both_Speaking_Chinese] Confine to brig , please . Eagle eye for rest of voyage bring reward . Right you are , sir . I 'll stick to him like Scotch glue . [Chinese] - [Sighs] - [Door_Closes] Thank you so much . [Ship's_Horn_Sounding] Move in there and get a close-up . A little closer , Mr . Bagley . Mind keeping his head up ? Thanks a lot . All right , hold it . - Thanks a lot , Mr . [Chester] . Thanks , Mr . Chan . - Okay . - Hello , Mr . [Chester] . - Hello , boy . How are you ? - Feeling pretty fine , sir . My leg 's almost as good as new . - Well , I 'm glad to hear it . Say , I 'm sorry you lost that race in Melbourne . I 'll bet it never would have happened if I 'd been riding him . That 's all part of the game , boy . Oh , I 'm sorry . This is Eddie Brill , the boy that used to ride for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chan . - Oh , I 've heard a lot about you , Mr . Chan . So pleased . What about these threats you received on the boat , Mr . [Chester] ? Avalanche will be under guard day and night , and no one else will be allowed near him . And I promise you that he will run in the handicap , wo n't you , boy ? - All right . Take him out to the trailer , Bagley . - How about you , Mr . Fenton ? Any of those new horses you bought over there show any promise ? Yes , Gallant Lad . I plan on entering him in the handicap Saturday . Well , what do you think of his chances ? Well , until the winner crosses the finish line ... it 's anybody 's money , is n't that right , [Chester] ? - That 's what makes horse racing . - [Animal_Screeching] - [Horse_Stomping] - [Man] Get down from there ! - Whoa ! Whoa , Gallant Lad ! - [Monkey_Screeching] Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lollipop ! Where you all goin ' ? - Confound that monkey ! Streamline ! - Yes , sir ? Get that monkey down from there before he gets Avalanche crazy too . Here , Mr . Fenton . - Hurry up . Get him off of there . - Yes , sir . Behave yourself . You 're the " fickliest " fool I ever did see . Why do n't you like your friend Gallant Lad no more ? Come on . Get going . Get out of here . Something very strange . What , Pop ? Before fire , monkey dislike Avalanche . Now dislike Gallant Lad . Say , that is funny . Not if horses switched . By golly , I bet that 's it . They could get away with it too . The horses look enough alike , and they 're the same build . What you gon na do ? Go to hotel , take nap . Hiya , Bagley . I thought you were in Australia . - Yeah , I know you did . What 's the new racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That horse you just put in the trailer ai n't Avalanche . That 's Gallant Lad . - Aw , you 're crazy . - Yeah ? You can fool [Chester] . He 's half blind anyway . But I ai n't . That fire was started on the boat to cover the switch . Not so loud . What 's the idea puttin ' an unknown palooka in Avalanche 's place ? - I ca n't answer that here . - Okay , where ? Come along with me . We could n't make a dime betting on Avalanche . He 's the favorite . The best we could get is even money . Sure , and nobody 's seen Avalanche in America . On the boat , the switch is made , and now Avalanche , in disguise ... goes to the post a horse no one ever heard of . Comes in a long shot with big odds . Catch on ? We 're plastering the country with bets from coast to coast at 20-to-1 , and we 'll clean up . Boy , that 's swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aw , you 're already in . Well , boys , we 've got a lot of work to do . Lefty , take Collins and get him planted somewhere where he can hide out and get a good rest . Oh , sure . I know just the spot . - Have a drink ? - Never touch it . - Need any money ? - Well , yeah , I could use some . Took almost all I had gettin ' away from Melbourne . Well , here 's a couple of hundred for you . Thanks , Bagley . I guess I had you figured all wrong . - That 's all right . - Let 's go , Collins . So long , fellas . Good-bye , Collins . Observe anything unusual during night ? Not a thing . There 's no one around this track who does n't belong here . Avalanche is guarded so closely , no one could get within a mile of him . Innocent grass may conceal snake . Not when you go through it with a fine comb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse a workout first . Well , if I can be of any further service , Mr . Chan- [Chuckles] Grateful for all kindness , [Captain] Wade . That 's all right . 1:38 and four-fifths . Not bad . Well , he 'll have to do better than that if he 's going to beat my horse . Mr . [Chester] , they 're bringing Avalanche out now . Can I ride him ? - [Chester] I would n't take a chance , Eddie . - Aw , but I can handle him , sir . - Honest , I can . I 've been able to ride for months now . - Some other time . Whoa , Avalanche ! Whoa ! Steady , boy ! Steady ! [Man] Hold him ! Hold him ! What 's the matter with that horse ? What 's the matter with that boy ? Why does n't he pull him up ? - [Man] Look out . Look out . Be careful there . - Come on now , boy . Hold him up . They 're gettin ' him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go over there . Dad , our horse made better time than that yesterday . What do you suppose is wrong ? - I told the boy to hold him back . - What for ? [Chester] Because I do n't want to advertise what we 've got . The odds will go down . - That 's a secret . - Uh-oh . Oh . [Chuckles] Interesting contraption , is n't it , Mr . Chan ? Excuse ignorance . May inquire nature of strange device ? Oh , that 's part of the latest system for timing the races . Uh , may explain , please ? Well , there 's a lamp in here . This directs a beam of light across the track ... to that little box on the other side which contains a photoelectric cell . The moment a horse passes through this beam , the cell operates ... and a picture of the finish of the race is taken up there ... in the camera-eye booth . Is possible to see , please ? Certainly . Come right along . - Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute ? I want you to meet Mr . Chan , Mr . [Charlie] Chan . - Oh , uh , glad to know you . - Thank you so much . Have you got time to explain the system , Al ? Mr . Chan is interested . Oh , sure , sure . Now to begin with , uh ... here 's the diagram of the track . At every quarter mile there 's a photoelectric cell . [Charlie] Mr . Barton already explained . - Shoot beam of light across track to time horses . - That 's right . - Say , Avalanche is just about to break . - Good . I 'll turn this on and show you how it works . Now , this light was automatically turned on when he went through the first beam . It also started the timer across the track . He 's coming to the first quarter . Now watch this light . - Twenty-three flat at the first quarter . - Avalanche is sure in form . Now , if you stand there beside the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track ... you 'll see that they point directly over the finish line ready to take a picture . This switch turns on the high-speed movie cameras ... and we 're now ready to take a picture of the finish . Here he comes . He 's over . And now the film we just took is being developed in this high-speed developer . In less than two minutes ' time , Mr . Chan ... we have taken an actual picture of the finish and sent it down to the judges ' stand . That 's all there is to it . Perfection of mechanical brain make [Charlie] Chan very humble . Thank you so much . Avalanche appears strangely excited . Excuse , please . Pop , I 've got it . I 've got it ! One moment , please . You disobey instructions to remain here in room . I was n't helping any by staying here , so-So you visit racetrack stables . Gee , Pop , how 'd you know ? Hay do not grow in hotel . [Man] who flirt with dynamite sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na let you take all the chances . Look , I got in the stable , and when the guard stepped outside for a smoke ... I took some pieces of cotton and some cleaning solution too . Reveal black dye on forehead of Gallant Lad ... and then white dye on forehead of Avalanche ? Yeah , and there 's the proof . But if they 've been switched , how did Gallant Lad ... come within one second of Avalanche 's fastest time this morning ? [Lee] There 's a screw loose somewhere . Maybe loose screw here in test tube . Did you find something , Pop ? Managed to secure foam from mouth of excited Avalanche ... after practice race this morning . Observe . Bubbles prove foam contain very powerful stimulant for heart . Today make masquerader run very fast to give appearance of champion . I 've got it , Pop . It 's [Chester] and Fenton in cahoot to cheat the public . Also possible gambling ring cahooting to cheat [Chester] and Fenton . Yeah , but Pop , what are we doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's murderer .

The Chesterjockey backs out in the face of danger . Avalanche is now without a rider . I 'm sorry , Mr . [Chester] , but I do n't want to take the chance .

Thousands are crowding the betting booths . The odds on Avalanche are less than even money but no takers . Golden Fleece is next at 3-to-1 . Shrapnel follows at four and so on down the line . Hold Away at 10-to-1 , Moneymaker at 10-to-1 ...

That 's what makes horse racing , ladies and gentlemen . May the best horse win . OnP.A . Ladies and gentlemen , it 's almost time ... for the feature race , the Santa Juanita Handicap .

[Cheering] [Announcer] Elsie [Lee] is crowding him close to the rail . Avalanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which this boy is noted . Richardson on Golden Fleece is using his whip . He 's set the pace , but the stamina of his horse ... is not equal to the terrific speed that Avalanche shows at the half . Golden Fleece and Avalanche are out together with Golden Fleece tiring . Avalanche is holding his own with that reserve for which he 's famous . Avalanche is forging ahead . He 's every bit the horse they promised us-a real favorite . Avalanche moves into the lead . Nothing can stop him now . It looks as if he 'll establish a track record for the distance . We could n't believe this horse Avalanche was as good as they promised , but he is . He 's better . Avalanche is now a length in front . He 's got the race in the bag . There 's no doubt about it , ladies and gentlemen . The favorite is still favored . At the three-quarter- Something 's happened ! He 's lost his stride . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one horse after another . He 's almost the real defender again . He 's passed Shrapnel . He 's passing Hold Away . He 's taking the measure of Golden Fleece . He 's still got a chance . You 've never seen a race like this before . This is the wonder horse of the age , the king of the turf . Here he comes . He 's a horse in 10 million . Avalanche is giving everything he 's got . He 's back with the leaders again . Golden Fleece falters . Avalanche is at his quarters . He 's even . They 're fighting it out neck and neck . Here they come- two magnificent animals tearing out their hearts in one last terrific struggle . There 's hardly an inch between them as they shoot down the stretch . This is a finish that 's going down in history . I 've never seen another like it . The final 50 yards . Avalanche literally hurls himself across the finish line . He 's over ! Avalanche wins ! - [Crowd_Clamoring] - He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! [Announcer] Clear the track , everybody ! Everybody off the track ! Come on , Meers . Cough it up . Who 's the ringleader ? Who 's been givin ' you orders ? - Nobody 's been giving us orders . - You 're lyin ' . Look here , I 'll talk to the D.A . We 'll make it easy on you . That would n't do any good . They 'd get me just like they got [Tip] Collins . [Tip] Collins ? That 's the guy they fished out of the ocean at Santa Monica this morning ! - [Intercom_Buzzes] - Yes ? - [Man] The police are here now , sir . - You can let them come in . I 'll take ' em down to headquarters , Mr . Lansing . - Maybe we can get more out of_'em there . - Come on . Look here , Lansing . I object to being held here like this for no apparent reason .

Chan ? - [Chuckles] Present . - Oh , Mr . Chan . - Thank you . Uh , happy to report Avalanche and jockey ... as son [Lee] would say , hunky-dory . Uh , please to sit down . Warren , did you know that up to 20 minutes before the race ... Avalanche was in your stall disguised as Gallant Lad ? What ? Why , such a thing is impossible . The switch was first made on the boat by Bagley . - Then why are we all herded up here like a lot of criminals ? - Mr . Chan will explain . Have here enlarged picture . Uh , show finish of race . Observe , please . [Charlie] Dart in shoulder of Avalanche . But where did it come from ? Who could have fired it with so many people around ? Explanation here in timing head . [Clicks] Also pleased to report ... person who fire same now in custody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with it , Mr . Chan . Perhaps can help , uh , solving fresh mystery . Dart very evident here ... yet strangely absent one moment later ... when doctor examine Avalanche . All present were first to reach side of noble animal . Someone use cover of excitement to remove dart . - A polite way of telling us we 're going to be searched ? - Have objection ? Not the slightest . You wo n't find it on me , Mr . Chan . Please . Also . This is nonsense . Now wait a minute . Dad , please . We 've nothing to worry about . Here it is . - Dad ! - Someone put that in my pocket . I was n't within six feet of Avalanche . It was you . You were one of the first to reach him , because I remember-Just a minute , Fenton . I see this all very clearly now . You wanted to buy Avalanche all along . When I refused to sell , you stole him and substituted your horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to protect Avalanche . - The whole thing 's ridiculous . The whole thing is obvious . You 're the only one who would have profited by the exchange . With Avalanche running for you as a ringer at 20-to-1 , you 'd have cleaned up a fortune . I guess that settles it , Mr . Fenton . You 're under arrest . - How dare you say that about my father ! - I 'll say more than that . Your father murdered Major Kent who raised Avalanche ... because he would have seen through the switch at once . He had to be gotten out of the way , so you struck him down ... with a winch shoe to make it appear that Avalanche kicked him to death . - That 's a lie ! - Alice ! Pardon , please . How you know winch shoe kill honorable major ? - Why , everyone knew that . - Contradiction , please . Only three beside humble self knew name of death weapon . Honorable chief of police ... most honorable captain of boat ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . It 's all very amusing , but I think it 's carrying a joke a little too far . [Charlie] Cold-blooded murder no joke . You and Major Kent frequently quarreled because of your gambling losses . - Well , what of it ? - Fearing investigation of same ... would reveal self as head of gambling ring ... you kill honorable major on board ship . It is n't true ! My husband often quarreled with Dad , but he could n't have done such a thing . Truth sometimes like stab of cruel knife . You very clever but make mistake . On boat in Honolulu when you receive threatening letter ... have no difficulty reading same without glasses ... because contents familiar . But glasses necessary to read very legible ... time stamp on envelope . Suspected hoax then , so get corroboration later ... when you need glasses to read fake letter ... sent by humble self . Next mistake . When Avalanche received cruel dart ... you make haste to remove same ... fearing evidence point to self . Anticipating search on sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr . Fenton . I think you 'll have a little difficulty in proving that idiotic story . Contradiction , please . Proof already in evidence . Blood of unfortunate Avalanche . Take away , please . So sorry . Mr . Chan , I have a confession to make . Have already arranged for you to make same to honorable stewards of track . - You knew ? - Too bad you did not expose plot ... when you first discover switch of horses . Temptation to cash in most unfortunate . Mr . Lansing , I will remove my stable from the track at once . I think that 's very wise . Wait for me , Dad . I just want to say good-bye to Mr . Chan . I do n't know how to thank you , Mr . Chan . You 've done so much for Dad . Uh , young man win money on race ? Enough to furnish a four-room flat , I guess . Good wife best household furniture .

The solemn truth , gentlemen , is ... that the federal union is on the verge of hysteria .

[Crowd_Shouting] - Is that clear ? - Yes , it 's clear . Briefly ... the voice of this court has got to be the voice of the people . [Angry_Shouting] Before you start , I want you to hear that voice . Listen to it . [Angry_Shouting_Continues] [Chattering] Bring the prisoners . Prisoners to the bar . This court is now in session . - Mr . President . - TheJudge Advocate General . The death ofJohn Wilkes Booth ... who was shot down while resisting arrest in Virginia ... has left us eight members ... of his criminal band . So , in the name of the government of the United States ... the crime of assassination and conspiracy ... to assassinate Abraham Lincoln ... then-president of the United States ... is charged against the following : David E . Herold ... Lewis Payne ... George A . Atzerodt ... Michael O'Laughlin ... Edward Spangler ... Samuel Arnold ... Mrs . Mary E . Surratt - - [Gasps] , Whimpers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr . Mudd ? I 'm General Ewing . With your permission , I should like to act as your counsel . Thank you , General . Thank you . We 'll fight together now , as we once fought each other . With the permission of the court ... we will begin the cases in order . We will start with the charge against George A . Atzerodt . Uh -- But is n't there any kind of news you can give us about - - about Dr . Mudd ? That 's all they 're gon na tell , lady - - just what you see on the board . That 's War Department 's orders . War Department 's orders ! Ha ! Did n't know they had one ! - Shh ! - Well , the dad-blamed -- Good night , [Sam] darling . The government will now present its case against Dr . Samuel A . Mudd . Tell them I 've got to speak . I 've got ta defend myself . I-- I ca n't let them treat me the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will instruct the defendant to remain silent and respect this court . I 'm confident , Mr . Erickson ... that after observing the conduct of these trials ... Dr . Mudd 's respect for this court ... is every whit as great as my own . [Man] Frank J . Thomas will take the stand . Tell the court what you know ... of Dr . Mudd 's loyalty to the federal union . Dr . Mudd was a dyed-in-the-wool slaver . Yes , sir ! Slaver ! Dr . Mudd 's name was on the prescription which I filled . Dr . Mudd served in the Confederate Army . Dr . Mudd denied that he 'd ever seen Booth . Dr . Mudd denied everything ... until I showed him Booth 's own boot right in his own home . Dr . Mudd , when I examined him in prison , confessed to me ... that he set Booth 's broken leg and then aided him with directions ... how to reach the Potomac and Virginia . - The case is ended . - No ! No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense you 're gon na hear whether you want it or not . - The prisoner will observe order . - Why ? Why ? What more could you do to me ? What threat have you got left ? You can hang me . You can hang us all - - the innocent as well as the guilty ! Because you - - you nine gallant officers and gentlemen - - have stripped yourselves of your pride and your honor . But I 'll not go without a fight . I 'll not go without trying to blacken your memories with the insane injustice ... you 'll carry on your souls till the day you die . ! And till the day you die , you 'll ask yourselves in your heart three questions : Does an assassin confide his plans to anyone ? Was I , a physician , in the plot ... because it was part ofJohn Wilkes Booth 's plan ... to break his leg and to need me ? Does a man , whose first devotion is no longer to a lost cause or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his child ... risk any act that could only cause misery and heartbreak ... on their innocent lives ? In the sight of the holy God I worship , I 'm innocent . The court will ignore the remarks of the prisoner . Sergeant ! And -- And you still ca n't tell me what they 've decided ? Lady , I must have told you 40 times ... that I do n't know any more than them bulletins . He 's coming now . Oh , but , General , is n't - - is n't there any possible means ... of - - of stopping things , just for a little while anyway ? My child , I 'm using every legal means that I know of . [Key_Clattering_In_Lock] Be brave , my dear . Peggy . [Martha] . - [Sobbing] - Now , now . No , darling . Do n't do that . It wo n't be long now . We 'll all be back together again . Darling . [Sam] . Do n't you know ? - Have n't they told you ? - Told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Sam] , the verdict ... was guilty . Guilty . I do n't know . It 's ... like a nightmare -- The way you ca n't fight , you ca n't run , you ca n't do anything . [All] the time , it 's coming towards you . Oh , but , darling , we have n't given up . We 're not through , not yet . No , Peggy , no . We 're not giving up - - you and [Martha] and me . But if Daddy has to stay away a little while longer . I want you to take care of Mama . You know ? Dry her tears , try to make her happy . Tell her , too , that in - - in the bottom drawer of the rolltop desk ... there are a lot of old bills - - bills that -- Well , Daddy never got around to collecting them . Maybe they 'll get enough , though , to send you to school ... buy you some new dresses . Try not to forget Daddy , wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go . We 're not giving up , not yet , dear ! Hey , bring him downstairs . My cell is here . [Chuckles] You ai n't going to need a cell anymore . - I 'll see General Hunter . I know him very well . - Oh , [Martha] . [Martha] . [Man] Shoulder . ! Halt . ! [Gasps] Oh , not now ! No , no . Not now ! Please ! No ! Steady . Steady , dear . Say , you got the best place in the yard , lady . Over yonder 's where they 're coming out . [Gasping] Courage . Courage , my dear . [Drumroll] [Drums_Stop] [Man] Right face . ! Forward march . ! [Drumroll] [Drums_Stop] Right face ! Forward march ! [Drumroll] [Sam] ! Darling ! Courage . Courage . [Stops] Well , looks like that 's all . He 's going to live ! Live ! Present arms ! [Gasps] , @cries_out [Drums_Stop] - Well , I guess the show 's over . - Phew . - What about him ? - Life imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison , sir . Hard one's . Report ' em to the officer of the guards . Yes , sir . Mudd-- Number 6 . [All] right . Left step ! - Next . - William A . Dunger . William Dunger - - insubordination , striking an officer . - Ten years . - Left step ! - Next . - Otto Lehrman . Otto Lehrman - - desertion , 20 years . You 'll never make it , Otto . You 're too old . The mosquitoes will get you . Left step ! - Next . - Samuel A . Mudd . Dr . Samuel A . Mudd . Dr . Mudd , I 've been waitin ' for you . So all they gave you was life . Could n't hang you , eh ? Well , byJudas , you 're gon na wish they had fore I 'm through with you ! Take a look at him , you filthy rats ! Take a look at the man who killed Abe Lincoln ... the greatest man who ever lived . Look at him ! Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left step ! [All] right . Drop your chains . Attention . Now , before we go any further here ... I want you to listen to me ... because I know exactly what you 're thinking ... every mother 's son of ya . You 're figuring on whether you 're gon na be able to break out of here . Well , we got a little way here of putting thoughts like that ... out of your heads . Follow me . You first , Doctor . Come on . Get up ! Halt ! Now , whenever you slops get to figuring ... on breaking out of here ... I just want you to give a little thought to this moat . It runs all around the island . It 's 7 5 feet wide ... and 35 feet deep . And you know what we keep in it ? We keep pets in it . Nice little pets . We got more pets in that moat than you can count . And sometimes we feed ' em . Not often . Oh , no . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to give ' em a little treat . Now watch close . ## [Whistling] [Buck] ! Move on , white man . - A prisoner , sir . - Just a minute . Now , you know , that 's quite interesting . Those are mosquito larvae . See there . But not very interesting to anyone but a medico , I 'm afraid . Well , I 'm also a physician , sir . No . Now I am pleased . That 's Dr . Mudd . Oh . Well , I - - I thought that -- I thought that , that as another physician , you would understand the circumstances - - the obligation of a doctor to - - to give aid to anyone , whoever he might be . Mr . Mudd ... if you assumed you might find sympathy here , get rid of the idea . The profession you have dishonored is ashamed of you ... ashamed of your membership in it . As a doctor , I may tell you that I despise you even beyond the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... to swear to you on the - - on the honor of the profession we both respect ... that I had nothing whatsoever to do with - - with the death of Mr . Lincoln ? It would be of no use whatever . I 'm sorry , sir . Bugle : Taps [Ends] [Buck] Marse [Sam] . ! Marse [Sam] . - Oh , [Buck] . - Marse [Sam] . I 's sorry , sir ... but I was too scared this afternoon . I could n't say nothin ' to you then . Oh , I knew . I knew that . Tell me , what are you doing down here ? - Oh , I 've been here a month waiting for you , sir . - You have ? Yes . You see , Mrs . Mudd , she told me to get on down this here man 's island . [Chuckling] So here I is - - done gone on down on it . Oh , you - - you 've given me the first hope I 've had since this - - since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . But , uh , here 's some soap I brung you . - What ? Oh , yes . I guess I do need it . - Yes , sir . - But it 's for the mosquitoes . - Mosquitoes ? - Yes , sir . You put it on your face and hands . - Oh , I know . I know . Yes , sir , because there 's more mosquitoes on this here man 's island ... than I 've ever seen before . - I know . That 's why -- - Watch it . [Footsteps] My home , sir . Darling , General Ewing . How do you do , General ? This is Judge Maiben of the district superior court . Why , how do you do , Judge ? - How do you do , sir ? - The judge is a Yankee , but he 's honorable . - Thank you , [Colonel] . - He 's gon na get [Sam] out of jail . - But , Colonel-- [Colonel] , please -- - Wo n't you sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me explain , General . At my request and for my own satisfaction ... Judge Maiben 's gone over the whole record of the case word by word . On the evidence produced , no civil court could hold Dr . Mudd for 1 0 minutes . You have some sort of plan , Judge ? The plan is , uh , Mrs . Mudd 's . No judge 'd dare devise anything quite so , uh , extreme . I explained toJudge Maiben what happened ... to the writ of habeas corpus you obtained for [Sam] . The government simply laughed at it . But ... if a writ was served on him in , say , Key West ... a civil municipality , it would be honored , would n't it ? Of course . But Dr . Mudd 's not in Key West . - I know he is n't ... yet . - What did I tell you ? But , great Scott , Mrs . Mudd , you surely would n't dare -- General Ewing , I 'd dare anything for my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It 's exoneration too . He 's innocent , and I want them to say so to the whole world . - But if we wait -- - Wait ? Wait for what ? For the government to kill my husband ? That 's all we 've done is wait and trust and have faith . Oh , I 'm so sick of waiting . I 've found a way to get [Sam] out . Just a moment , Mrs . Mudd . Now , all I have to say is this . If Dr . Mudd should be able to deliver himself to the civil authorities in Key West ... I could have a writ of habeas corpus there to be served on him . Now , under its protection , he could be brought back here . I 'd reopen the case , and I feel sure ... give him a far different trial than the one he had at the court-martial . But as to how Dr . Mudd ... is going to be able to get to Key West ... well , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , and remember ... I wo n't be the only Yankee who 'll be praying with you . - And do n't let anything disturb you . - I won't . - Good day , gentlemen . - Good day . We 'll sell , pawn , mortgage everything . We 'll get enough money . Oh . You understand what this means to me , do n't you ? It 's all that 's left of our lives - - [Sam] 's and [Martha] 's and mine . And it 's only your support - - your support behind us - - that we 're asking . You can leave the escape entirely to me , sir . Within 2 4 hours , I 'll have 5,000 of my old brigade under my command . We 'll seize a war vessel or two and blow the whole dad-blamed prison to ashes ... and deliver [Sam] in Key West with a guard of honor . I 'm sorry , Mrs . Mudd ... but if you 're set on such a foolhardy plan ... I must withdraw from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got to be free to be tried . - It 's the only way . Oh , do n't you see ? - I 'm sorry . - The risk is too great . - Igad , sir ! And if you 'll take my advice , you too will abandon this mad scheme . - What do you think ? - [Chuckles] Igad , sugar ... we 'll show these dad-blamed , chickenhearted Yankee lawyers ! [Groans] You leave it to me . I 'm gettin ' tired of this fiddling ' around , messin ' around . Lawyers ! Lawyers are no-good -- Oh . Yeah , lawyers are dad-blamed old women with their habeas corpus and all that . Lookee there . There . You see that ? StonewallJackson gave me that . Pure Toledo . And if I do n't get $1 50 for that ... I 'll have the pleasure of spitting the heart of the swine that dare offer me less . Open the door ! Marse [Sam] ! - Marse [Sam] ! - Yes , [Buck] ? Thanks . Thanks . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed my name up a little bit to make it sound kind of nice . [Buck] , I 'm ready . - But tonight , sir ? - Yes , tonight . But how about the moat and them sharks ? - I 'm gon na have to try the bridge . - But they got a guard on it . - Yeah , I know . - Watch it . - Marse [Sam] . - Yeah . - If I could go with you -- - Yes . I can arrange to be the guard that 's on the bridge . If you could arrange to be the guard on the bridge , we could both go together . - Now , listen . - Yes , sir . There 's gon na be a boat . It 's gon na flash two lights . I 'm gon na have to swim to it . [Guard] Nice view ? [Lock_Unlatching] What 's outside ? Just outside . Do n't start anything you might be sorry for , Doctor . [Cell_Door_Closes] Second guard detail , forward step ! [Guard] detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . What were you doin ' down in that cell block ? - Uh , cells which ? - I saw you . ! No , sir . T'were n't me . As you were . Left face . Forward step ! - What 's up ? - I do n't know , but I 'm gon na find out . What post is that boy [Buck] on ? - The bridge . He swapped with another one of them . - That 's what I thought . Relieve him . Place him under arrest and bring him here . - What 's up ? - Mudd 's out . Wait ! He 's out , but I do n't want him back alive . Do you understand ? Post extra guards to the bridge . Notify all sentries . We 'll see if we can give this Judas what the court-martial should 've given him . Tell them to shoot and shoot straight ! [Guard] , watch that -- No . Wait . [Guard] that magazine over there . Quick step ! [Waves_Crashing] [Man] Halt . ! Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star boarder 's out . ! - What ? - Yeah , and Rankin do n't want him back . His orders are to shoot on sight . [Man] If I see him , I will , with pleasure . Mudd 's out ! Double all your guards . Guards , halt ! Cover that cell . You cover that house there . Go and watch that gate . The rest of you , follow me . Get ! Soldier . ! You 're under arrest . - But I just -- - Keep it to yourself . Move ! Take your post . [Whispering] [Buck] ! [Buck] ! [Yells] [Buck] ! [Gunshot] ## [Call_To_Assembly] [Man] Bring out those pieces on the double . Hurry it up . ! [Bugle_Continues] [Gunfire_Continues] Give me that . Wait ! [Gunshot] There ! There he is ! [Gunfire_Continues] Keep firing ! He 'll never make it ! If we do n't get him , the sharks will . - What sharks ? - What sharks do you think , sir ? Sergeant , with that barrage on the water ... you 're lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards of this spot . Stop firing , you fools ! You wan na drive those sharks away ? Keep your eyes open . ! [Man] I-I do n't see anything down here . Out yonder ! He 's outside ! [Gunfire_Continues] There 's a boat putting ' in toward him . Rankin , man two boats . I want that man back . Alive ! You understand ? Yes , sir . Boat crew number one ! Number two ! - [Man] your boats ! - [Man] Number one . ! [Shouting] , Indistinct [Shouting] Pull , you mangy rats ! - Starboard a little more . - There he is , boys ! Pull him in ! Pull , you lazy rats ! On your way ! You 're all right now , [Sam] . Come along . That 's a boy . [Panting] He 's all right now . He 's all right . Now , get him right over here in this bunk . It 's all right . There you are , [Sam] . That 's a boy . - Oh , darling , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . Do n't get him excited . Good . - Oh , my darling , you 're wounded . - He 's all right now . - You 're an angel , Peggy . - Everything 's arranged for . You 're gon na have a new trial . And [Martha] 's waiting . - Where 's [Martha] ? - In Key West . She has n't ... forgotten me ? Oh , my sweet , not for one little minute . [Gunfire] Igad , I 'll soon stop this ! - You stay here with [Sam] . - Dad ! Dad ! - No ! - [Gunshot] Oh , they ca n't take you back . They ca n't ! [Sobs] Hiya , Judas . [Sobbing] [Woman] And then the prince leaned down ... and kissed the sleeping beauty on both eyes - - smack , smack . - And what do you suppose happened ? - [Martha] What ? - [Woman] The sleeping beauty waked up . - Mama . ! Where 's Daddy ? Daddy ... could n't come , darling . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't mean forever . He 'll come yet . He will , I promise you . Where 's Grandpa ? Grandpa 's gone away . He 's gone a long , long way away . Forever ? Forever . [Sobs] How long has it been , Marse [Sam] ? I do n't know . Three , maybe - - maybe four days , I guess . Marse [Sam] ... can I have a little bit more of that water ? I ai n't even heard no bugle calls . Ai n't even seen nobody . No food , no nothin ' . I guess everybody just done run on off and left us . Reckon it 'd do any good to holler again ? No , I hollered till I 'm hoarse . What you suppose happened ? I do n't know , [Buck] . Maybe - - Maybe just as you say -- That they have gone off and left us to die maybe . Tell the captain of that ship I 've got to have those supplies . Tell him I got a thousand hospital cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry , but I refuse to put in . Tell him he 's a filthy yellow coward with my compliments . Tell him I 've waited five bloody days ... for him to make up his lily-livered soul to be a man and deliver me my medicine . And now , if I do n't see some action out there inside of five minutes ... I 'm gon na turn a cannon on his bloody tub and blow it to kingdom come ... government ship or no government ship ! That 'll make you sleep a little . You 're gon na be all right , son . [Sighs] Good morning , Clark . Are you all right , sir ? Just tired . Very tired . It 's a hard job , son . Always a hard job when you do n't know what to do ... and got no one to do it with you .

If ever I get my hands on that muck 's throat -- Imagine the hound , loading my supplies on rafts ... and just shoving ' ' em toward the shore through that surf . Look at ' em ! Scared to land ' em . Scared to touch ' em . Scared to tend ' em when they 're sick . Holy mother ! How long do they expect to live ? Forever ? Beg pardon , sir . If the commandant pleases , there 's a doctor among the prisoners . - Dr . Mudd . - Mudd ? - Yes , sir . - Dr . Mudd ? Come on . Open up . Doctor , I 'm here on a curious mission . I want your help . - My help ? - I need it desperately . Doctor , this island is a pesthole . It 's teeming with yellow fever . The worst epidemic we 've had in years . I 've got 3,000 men here - - soldiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or crazy with terror ... and we 're all trapped here together . What 's all this to me ? That 's what you must decide for yourself , sir . And the good Dr . MacIntyre ? The good Dr . MacIntyre is down bad . You 're quite right . You could n't possibly be in a better position ... to tell me and my men to go straight to the devil . And no one would understand it better than I would . In your place , I 'd do it myself . But in spite of that and in spite of the fact ... that I can promise you no reward ... that I can offer you nothing but exposure to death ... I want your help . Once before , I was a doctor . I 'm still a doctor . Thank you , Dr . Mudd . [Buck] . [Buck] . We 're - - We 're going up in the open . Will you give me a hand , sir , please ? It was the last straw when they heard about Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the mess hall now barricaded , guards and all . We 've got to do something , sir .

I wrote it down on the back of an envelope for you . But it 's enormous . I 'm overcome . It 's the Grand Central Station . Bad echo .

I 'd have asked you to marry me in two days instead of ten . - Are n't you funny ? - Funny , why ? Well , to talk about it . - Money ? Why , is it so sacred ? - No , of course not . I 'm simply delighted . That 's all . If I suddenly discovered you could play piano , I 'd be delighted . Having money is like knowing how to play the piano ?

Take heart from Grandfather . - Do n't tell me you 're one of those Setons ? - Yes , Johnny . Forgive us , but we are . This is too much . What man has done , man can do , or words to that effect . Now see here , if you think I 'm going to be any young wizard of finance , you 're ... . Cheer up , it 's not at all that serious . If you do n't think breaking the news of this engagement to Father is serious ... . - You said you were going to church ? - I am . That 's why I 'm clever . Because Father 's in church and in church Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? - No . But this is the best way . You know , Father is a wonderful man , but he has to be handled just right . You leave that to me . Your job is to drop me off at church and be back before 1:00 for lunch and do n't be late . His first impression of you is terribly important . What if I crawled in on my hands and knees ? Would he like that ? Now do n't jest , boy . Now , come on , darling . Let 's not let the fun get out of it . - Is it likely to ? - No , but ... . Say it . Well , what 's the idea of spilling it so quickly ? Well , I have to tell Father . He 'd never forgive me . Yeah , but it could be such a swell guilty secret for a while .

Tell me everything . - I was ... . - Well , I ... . Go ahead . I was walking along the road one morning to the rink when whom should I see , but this man coming along carrying his skis . Well , fancy that . A downright romance . Go on , dear . He had a queer look on his face . I can believe that . His eyes must have been burning . No . As a matter of fact , the trouble was with his nose . So I stopped him and said : " Pardon me . I do n't think you realize it , but your nose is frozen . " He said , " Thanks . Can you personally do something about it ? " - Fresh . - I thought so , too . She was fresh to mention it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing when I see it . Just a minute .

I did n't know I was marrying into a house with an elevator . It is n't only the elevator . The place is haunted . You mean ghosts ? Frightful ghosts all wearing stuffed shirts and mink-lined ties . Any skeletons in the closet ? - Julia has n't told you about Grandfather ? - No . - He stole a railroad from the stockholders . - That 's not true . And of course you 've heard about me . I 'm the black sheep . That 's a goat . - Do n't pay attention to her . - The engagement 's off . I wo n't marry into any family with a black sheep . - I think I like this man . - Hello .

Will you please tell me ... . Marry ? Did you actually say that ? Charming service . - A lovely service . - Thank you . - We shall have to talk at once , Julia . - Yes . You have n't as yet told me one intelligent fact about this ... . Johnny ? He 's a man with a definite future . He 's with Sloan and Hobson . - Indeed ? I know Sam Hobson . - You do ? Hello , Julia . Hello , Marjorie . You look well . - A mild , lovely Sunday , Edward . - Quite . - Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . I do n't seem to have been there when it happened . - Good morning . - Good morning . Good morning . Kindly put your hat on , Ned . I believe I see Mr . Hobson now . - Run along home . - Yes , Father . Take your time , Father . The front door this time . Miss Julia has not returned from church yet , sir . I 'll walk around the block . - You 're expected in the playroom , sir . - Playroom ? Miss Linda asked that you be sent up the moment you arrived , sir . Miss Linda . - The playroom is on the fourth floor , sir . - Thanks . - Hey ! - Hey , yourself . I 'm lost . A lot of people have n't been coming up here . Want a bite ? Thanks . The bell captain sent me up . This is quite different . From the rest of the house , I mean . This was Mother 's idea . She thought there should be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here as much as we were before she died . I think it was a kind of escape for her . She was marvellous . That 's quite a doll . - That was Julia's . - Yeah ? She loved it . My , how she loved it . Looks like her . Did she love that , too ? Now do n't you say a word about Leopold . He 's very sensitive . - Yours ? - Looks like me . - Who 's the musician in the family ? - My brother , Ned . I saw him this morning when I arrived . At least I saw somebody with a hangover . That was Ned . He could have been a fine musician . - What do you mean ? - lf Father had n't interfered . - Who performed on the flying trapeze ? - All of us . And a terrible cousin of ours named Seton Cram . He and I used to swing by our knees and spit at each other . - Nice goings-on . - I 'm happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I as kids . She was beautiful even then , was n't she ? Case ? What ? I love my sister Julia more than anything else in the world . I do n't blame you , so do I . She 's so sweet , you do n't know . Yes , I do . She 's beautiful and exciting , too , do n't you think ? Stop it . I 'll start jittering . It 's terribly important that she should marry the right person . - That 's important for everyone . - No . It 's particularly so for Julia . I suppose you realize you 're a rather strange bird in these parts ? How 's that ? You do n't know the men we see as a rule . Where 've you been ? Working hard . - Nights ? - Nights , too . What about these little jaunts to Placid ? Come clean , Case . Want to know something ? That was the first holiday I ever had . - No . - Sure . - Then you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was 10 . - Ten ? - Sure . At what ? Anything I could get . Financial house the last few years . Does she paint ? She never told me . No , you don't . - Why , is n't she any good ? - It is n't hers , it 's mine . There lies Linda the artist . Do n't disturb the ashes . Frankly , I stank . What did you try after you discovered you could n't paint ? - Case , are you drawing me out ? - Sure . Come on . - You really want to know ? - Sure . Well , I tried to go on the stage . Would you care to see me do the sleepwalking scene from Macbeth ? - " Out , damned spot ! " - No , some other time . The teachers at Miss Porter 's School thought it was very promising . - What else ? - There were lots of humorous episodes . I tried to get Father to let me take a nursing course at a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help some strikers over in Jersey . How was I to know that Father was on the board of directors of the company ? You see , Case , the trouble with me is that I never could decide whether I wanted to be Joan of Arc , Florence Nightingale or John L . Lewis . - What 's the matter , you fed up ? - To the neck . Even with this million-dollar museum ? All those marble pillars down there ? Case , compared to the life I lead the last man in a chain gang thoroughly enjoys himself . What you need 's some time off from what you 've been doing day in , day out . You mean from what I 've not been doing days in , please , years out . How does your garden grow , Case ? Is life wonderful where you are ? It can be . - But it has n't been ? - I do n't call what I 've been doing " living . " - What do you recommend for yourself ? - A holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I need . - You mean just to play ? - No , I 've been working since I was 10 . I want to find out why I 'm working . The answer ca n't be just to pay bills or pile up more money . Even if you do , the government takes most of it . - But what is the answer ? - That 's what I intend to find out . The world is changing out there . There 's new exciting ideas running around . Some right , some cock-eyed , but they are affecting our lives . I want to know how I stand , where I fit in , what all this will mean to me . I ca n't find that out sitting behind a desk in an office . I 'm going to get money together , and then knock off . - Quit ? - Quit . I want to save part of my life for myself . There 's a catch to it though , it 's got to be part of the young part . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work when I know what I 'm working for . - Does that make sense to you ? - That makes a lot of sense . - Does Julia know ? - No . I wo n't get her hopes up until I get enough money . She has enough for two right now , or for 10 , for that matter . I do n't want her dough . I 've got to earn it myself . That 's foolish . You 're all right , though . You have n't been bitten or caught by it yet . - By what ? - The reverence for riches . - Look out for that , Johnny . - No , not for me . - Who took the Scotch from my closet ? - What happened in church ? - It was in my riding boots , a full quart . - Neddie , shut up . Did Julia tell Father ? I have n't been up here in years . What did Father say ? We left Father talking about that guy to Mr . Hobson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I 'm the egg . And he 's a good egg , too . Johnny Case , my brother , Ned . How are you ? Congratulations ! This place gives me the creeps . I 've been telling Johnny about some of our childhood dreams . Some dreams . It 's in tune . I thought you 'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing . The Seton Concerto in F Major . Come on , Neddie . Neddie , play it . Play it , Neddie . Johnny and I can bear it . Ca n't we ? You really want to hear it ? Neddie , no . I 've been boasting about you . Hello . What are you all doing up here ? What a morning . - What did Father say ? - He is n't home yet . I want to know the minute Mr . Seton returns . Buzz up here twice , will you ? Thanks . - Was it terrible at church ? - Not so bad , but there 's dirty weather ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't change that tie . - That 's right , I did n't . Well , never mind , Ned can lend you one . I feel like a goat being prepared for the sacrifice . Now , that 's a sheep . What you need is a drink . - We 'd better give him some coaching . - I 'd be grateful . Firstly , Father will want to know how you 're fixed . - Fixed ? - Money . How much ? You would n't expect it of a man in Father 's position , but money is our God here . - Johnny , it is n't true at all . - No ? What is , then ? Well , young man ? Well , sir , at the moment I have in my pocket exactly $34 and a coupon for a Bank Night at a Lake Placid movie . No gilt-edge securities , no rolling woodlands ? I have a few shares of common stock tucked away in a warm -- Common , do n't say the word . I 'm afraid he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but probably just another of the vast army of clock-watchers . - How are you socially ? - Nothing much there either . Your mother was n't even a whooziz ? - Nope . - Linda , I do wish you 'd shut up . - Maybe he 's got a judge in the family . - Yes , that might help . Old Judge Case 's boy . White pillars , guitars a-strumming . - ' Evening , Master . - How you all , Miss Linda ? - Know any prominent people ? Drop names . - Just casually , you know . At Mrs . Onderkonk 's cockfight last Tuesday , whom should I see but Mrs . Marble . - I thought we 'd die laughing . - Johnny , this is rot . " Johnny , " she calls me ... . - Linda , will you be quiet ? - I 'm having a swell time . This is terrible . Do you realize that you are trying to marry into one of America 's 60 families ? When I find myself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Then I do the opposite . As long as you do n't do a back flip-flop . - Can you do a back flip-flop ? Really ? - Sure . But , you 'll have to teach me . I can do almost anything else . It 'll be a pity if it does n't come off , it 'll be a real pity . Yes , it 'll be a pity if this does n't come off , too . Okay . Alley . It 's Father . He 's home . Come on , Johnny . - What about the flip thing ? - No . Linda and I will go down and talk to him . You go with Ned . - Why ? - You 're not supposed to have arrived yet . - When do I arrive ? - 1:00 . 1:00 . And please change that tie . Ned will tell you exactly when to put in an appearance . This is getting very complicated , if you ask me . Nobody asked you . Now go on . Do as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't expect simplicity here . Just think of Fifth Avenue frontage . Lend him a tie , Ned . - You do like him , do n't you ? - She asks me if I like him . Dear girl , do you realize that life walked into this house this morning ? Darling , do n't let him get away . It 'll be the same old story , of course . - I 'm being married for my money . - That 's always flattering , is n't it ? What 's the use of all we 've got unless to get us a superior type of man ? Linda , I hate you to talk like that . But , Julia , seriously he 's like spring . He 's like a breath of fresh air . Do you know what he called this place ? A museum . Julia , here 's your chance . That 's just it . I want Father to see that Johnny has the same qualities Grandfather had . You do n't know Johnny . You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Or where he 's going . - I do . I know , I can see it as clear as day . If it does go through all right , when are you going to announce it ? - Right away . Next Saturday . - Darling , let me give a party for it . Now look , Father is to have nothing to do with it . Saturday is New Year 's Eve . Julia , let 's have some fun in this house before you leave it . - lf Father does n't mind . - No ifs at all . And just a few people . Just your friends and Johnny 's and up in the old playroom . Let me plan it . Let me give it . Let me do something for you once . Me , Julia . I 'd love it darling , really I would . No , but you see , this is awfully important to me now . Now no one must touch my party but me , do you hear ? All right , darling . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Linda it 'll be awful to leave you . Julia , I do n't know what I 'll do when you go . I 've got to do something . I 've got to get out , quit , change on it somehow or I 'll go mad . I could curl up and die right now . Why , my foot . I do n't look sick , do I ? You know , this is a museum . Never mind about me . I 'll be all right . Look out for yourself . Do n't let him bully you . - Good morning . - Good morning , Father . - Did you see Mr . Hobson , Father ? - Just for a moment . There 's another thing to be considered . What is the young man 's background ? What did Mr . Hobson say ? But we must n't rush into things , must we ? I want to be married on January 10 . That 's two weeks from this Tuesday . Impossible . - Why ? - Yes , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy has loads of charm , Father . - You know him ? - I 've heard tell of him . Charm . I suppose it 's solid merit you 're after . The rumour is he 's got that , too . A sterling chap on the whole . A catch , in fact . Have you the financial section of the Times , Ned ? No . I try to take Sundays off when I can . Which reminds me , I 'd like you to remain in the office until 6:00 . - 6:00 ? What for ? - As an example to the other men . - But there 's nothing for me to do after 3:00 . - You 'll find something . See here , Father , if you think I 'm going to fake -- Did you understand me , Ned ? Father , what did Mr . Hobson say ? It was n't the time or place to go into the matter with him . I asked him to drop by tonight . Father , but what did he say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a blow . - He appears to have some business ability . He has put through a successful reorganization of Seaboard Utilities . - Seaboard ? Poor fellow . - Shrewd fellow , perhaps . Hobson says the signs are not unfavourable for Seaboard . We 'll buy some in the morning , Ned . But we must know more about Mr . Chase 's background . Case , Father . Let it go . Chase has such a sweet banking sound . - Father , he 's from Baltimore . - Fine , old , pre-war stock , I imagine . Was n't there a Judge Case somewhere ? I intend to know more about the young man than his name and his place of birth . It would be advisable that when he arrives he finds me alone in order that I may conduct the inquiry along my own lines . I wo n't allow the subject of an engagement to come up in my first talk with him . Would n't you like me to hide under the sofa and take shorthand notes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the poor guy ought to see one friendly face in the courtroom . Yes , Henry ? - Mr . Case wishes to be announced , sir . - Yes , Henry . You will all excuse yourselves on one pretext or another . Keep a stiff upper lip , Father . No doubt the fellow is an impostor . - Father . - Yes , Julia ? Remember , I know what I want . Come in . I hope I 'm not late . I got caught in traffic . Father , this is Mr . Case . - How do you do ? - How do you do , sir ? My daughter Linda . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? And my son , Edward . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? Ned , if you and your sisters will do the telephoning you spoke about I shall try and entertain Mr . Case . We 'll be back in a few minutes , Johnny . What would we do without the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Linda ? Me , Father ? I ca n't remember a thing . We seem to be enjoying quite an unusual freedom from snow this winter . I like snow . That 's why I went up to Lake Placid . Placid ? Yes , my daughter Julia has just come from there . Yes , I know . - You 're in business in New York , Mr . Case ? - Yes , sir . I 'm with Sloan and Hobson . An excellent firm . - A born New Yorker ? - No , no . I was born in Baltimore . July 6 , 1908 . I 'm 30 . I used to have a lot of good friends in Baltimore . Let me see . The Whites , the Clarence Whites . - Possibly you knew them ? - I do n't believe I ever did . - No ? And there was Archer Fuller 's family . - I 'm afraid not . Let me see , Colonel Evans , old Philip Evans . No . I have n't been there in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . You see , my father had a small grocery store in Baltimore . Yes . He never made a go of it though and when he died he left several debts which Mother worked hard to clear up . I was just a child at the time and I could n't help her very much . Mother died the May before my 16th birthday . How sad . Yes , it was pretty sad . I had n't any connections except for an uncle who 's in the roofing business in Wilmington . He was n't much good , though . He was inclined to get drunk . Still is . We have an uncle like that but he keeps off roofs . Mother had wanted me to go to a big Eastern college so I worked my way through Harvard . In vacations , I worked in a steel mill and in an automobile factory . One summer I drove a garbage truck . Admirable . No , they simply happened to be the only jobs I could get but you can learn a lot in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard . Anything else , sir ? I beg your pardon ? I should think you would . Is there anything else you 'd like to know about me ? Why , that is ... . Well , Mr . Seton , how about it ? - About it ? About what ? - About Julia and me , getting married . Why , this is a complete surprise to me . I hardly know what to say to you . - Well , " yes " would be pleasant . - I 'm sure it would . However , we must go into the matter a little more carefully , I 'm afraid . The only difficulty about that is the time . Julia 's idea is January 10 . Mine , too . We 'll see about that . May I ask how we shall see , sir ? Mr . Case , I do n't know you at all . I 'll give you every opportunity you permit me . - Lunch tomorrow ? - Tomorrow I have -- Tuesday ? Suppose you meet me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , but Friday 's out . I 've got business in Boston that day . Better make it tomorrow . I 'll see whether I can rearrange my engagements . Ned , Julia , nearly time for lunch , is n't it ? In the meantime , I think Mr . Sloan or Mr . Hobson might say a good word for me . I 'm decent and civilized and I love your daughter , which is n't hard . She seems to like me , too , and that 's about all that can be said for me except that we have a grand chance of being happy . - So do I . - Come on , Father , be an angel . The matter is too important to be decided offhand . You 'll be married when I 've come to a decision and on a day which I will name . - Our plan was the 10th . - That is out of the question . - Yes , Henry ? - Luncheon , sir . - Mr . Seton , l -- - Luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . Thank you . I have a haberdasher who 's made my ties for a good many years and that particular pattern I seem to recognize . Possibly , sir , because this happens to be your necktie . Ned and I thought it might bring me luck . Father . Come in , Julia . I thought you might like some hot chocolate . Thank you . I just saw Mr . Hobson leave . - Did you and he have a nice talk ? - Yes . Father what have you decided ? Marriage is an extremely important step for a young girl . Mother was younger than I when she married you . In marrying me , your mother and her family took no risk , either financially or , if I may say so , spiritually . - Johnny will do well financially . - No doubt about it . - Hobson tells me he has great possibilities . - I know it . Then it 's all right ? - Do you see that cigar ? - Yes , Father . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your grandfather smoked the same brand . I know the quality of tobacco in it because I own the plantation where it was grown and I know therefore that when I light it , it will burn smoothly and pleasantly . And I know above everything else that it will never explode in my face . And you 're afraid that Johnny might ? There 's a strange new spirit at work in the world today a spirit of revolt . I do n't understand it and I do n't like it . Do n't worry about Johnny . I know him better than you . My dear , I 've never denied you anything that was in my power to give . He 'll burn , Father , calmly , steadily , pleasantly . It 's only of you and your happiness I 'm thinking . Father you can trust me . I 'll take care of myself . Thank you , Father . - Can we announce it New Year 's Eve ? - I shall arrange a party . How wonderful ! Linda had said something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of hers . I think by now you and I know how to take care of those ideas of Linda's . - It was awfully sweet of her . - Linda has many generous impulses . Father ? Come in , Linda . Is it yes ? Father , I knew you 'd do it . - Be careful , you 'll put my cigar out . - What 's a cigar on a night like this ? Darling , I 'm so glad . Have you told Johnny ? - I have n't had time . - Telephone him right away . Well , then let 's ring bells . Let 's send up skyrockets . Let 's turn on all the lights in the house . Father , are n't you proud of yourself ? Gee , this would have made Mother happy . Mother , you 'd love him . Do n't forget I 'm to give the party to announce the engagement . I 've got it all planned . Just a few people , Johnny 's friends and Julia 's and up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no engraved invitations . I like your tie , too . - By the way , where 's Linda ? - She 'll be down soon . I 'm sure she will . - She just hates big parties . - But not this one ? Johnny , look at Father . He 's just seething with excitement . You 've won his heart completely . - He 's been awfully nice to me . - Father 's such a dear . He made all the arrangements for the party himself . Is that the fellow ? He 's rather good-looking at least . - Hello , Uncle Edward . - Good evening . - Seton . - Good evening , Uncle Edward . There 's Laura and Seton Cram . He 's my cousin . Darling , tell me , when are you to announce the exciting news about Julia ? Shortly after midnight as a surprise . Well , Julia seems divinely happy . What does Linda say ? You know , we have n't seen Linda all evening . Linda has been somewhat indisposed . If asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , Linda 's headaches . Now , do n't worry , darling , we understand perfectly . She shall come down before the announcement . Of course . Now do n't worry , darling , you just leave everything to us , will you ? It 's a lovely party . Now what 's the matter with Linda ? Hello , Dorothy , you look lovely . - Dear , where 'd she get that horrible dress ? - Uncle Edward is worried , is n't he ? - Hello , Bunny . - Hello , Seton . I 'd be worried , too , if I had children like Ned and Linda . Now he takes an utter stranger into the family . I do n't approve of it at all . If Linda had done it I could understand , but for Julia to take an unknown climber ... . Mother 's furious about it . He 's obviously after Julia 's money . Hello , Countess . He does n't even belong to the Harvard Club . Julia , darling , you look lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Hello , Seton . - I 'm Cousin Laura and I 'm so happy about it . My dear , he is attractive , is n't he ? This is my husband , Seton Cram . He 's Julia 's cousin . - I married into the family . - Not a bad family to marry into . Congratulations . - Thank you , Mr . Cram . - Do n't " Mister " him . We grew up together . We 've heard such wonderful things about you . - Have you ? From whom ? - Well , from everybody . My dear , it 's such a shame about Linda . She does have such frightful luck with those headaches of hers , does n't she ? Yes . There 's Ned . We 've been looking for him . Come on . We 'll see you later . - Good-bye , Johnny . - See you later , Johnny . Ned , did you speak to Linda ? How do you like Seton and Laura ? It 's a privilege to meet them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheer up , Johnny . If you find Seton and Laura dull , wait until you meet some of the others . The more you find out about us Setons , the more impressive we become . Father wanted a big family , you know . Mother had Linda straight off to oblige him . Linda was a girl , so she promptly had Julia . Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless . The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land . It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish . It must have been a consolation to Father . He must have been very grateful to Mother . Drink to Mother , Johnny . She tried to be a Seton for a while , then gave up and died . You 're talking through your hat , Ned . But , I 'm not . Ned , what did Linda say ? - She 's coming down , is n't she ? - Do n't make me laugh , Sister . - What 's all this about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . It 's nothing . Just one of Linda 's whims . The silly little girl wanted to give her kind of a party . Between you and Father you 've changed her shindig into a first-class funeral . She should 've realized Father could n't announce my engagement without a fuss . She should have , yes , but unlike me , Linda always hopes . Bottoms up to Linda . Ned , please , you 've been drinking steadily since 8:00 . Yes , funny old Ned . On New Year 's Eve , too . Johnny , try to stop him . I shall drink as much as I like at any party I agree to attend . And as much as I like is as much as I can hold . It 's my protection against your tiresome friends . Linda 's out of luck . She has n't any protection . Robert , another highball , please . Ned , take it easy . Aye , aye , sir . - The name , sir ? - The name is Professor Nicholas Potter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ' cloakroom is the second door to the left , madam . Thank you . - Hello , Mr . Thayer . - Well . - It 's getting near the New Year . - That 's right , sir . - It lacks about an hour , I should say . - An hour and 38 minutes , Edgar . Thank you , sir . - The elevator is to the rear and right . - Would it be too much -- Hello , Mr . Jennings . - Coming close to the New Year now . - One hour and 27 minutes , Edgar . - He 's fast . - Yes , sir . The elevator is to the rear and right . - Thank you , but you have my shoe . - I beg your pardon . It 's quite all right . A very natural mistake , as a matter of fact . Thank you . I 'll do it . Do n't tell anyone , but I 've got a run in my stocking . Good heavens , we 're ruined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - No , sir . The elevator ... . Is to the rear and to the right . I 'm sorry . - Perhaps we 'd better use the elevator . - To the rear and to the right . I think we 'd better go home . Courage , dear , courage . Remember , we promised Johnny that we 'd come . This reminds me a little of the palace of the Emperor Caligula . - You remember Caligula , do n't you ? - Very well , indeed . Whatever became of him ? - To the rear ... . - And to the right . Now where ? Seems to have been some sort of a residence at one time . It 's the Gashouse Gang , darling . The party 's downstairs . Thank you . Sorry to intrude . No . Wait a minute . - You 're Susan Elliott ? - Yes . My married name is Potter . No , but you lectured once at our school . I 'm Linda Seton . - You 're not . - Yes . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister . - You know Johnny ? - For years . I 'm so glad to see you . Come in . - Who 's that ? - That is my husband , Nick Potter . You can come in , too . Close the door . Who lives here ? I live here . I live here , in a manner of speaking . I see . You would n't eat your oatmeal this morning , so they wo n't let you go to the party ? I 'm the mad sister , the family problem . The one they do n't speak about . - Yes , so was I . - You see what happened to her . - What ? - She had to marry me . A professor without a cent of money . So you 'd better be a good little girl and eat your porridge . - Sit down , will you ? - Thank you . - My , it 's good to be home again . - Yes , we 've had quite a long walk . - This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to give a party tonight . I had it all planned . I was going to ... . Well , it was a good idea . It might have been fun . - Your sister , Julia . - Is she anything like you ? Do n't worry , she 's not at all like me . - Have n't you met her yet ? - No . You must . Johnny 'll be glad to see you . - But you must . It 'll spoil Johnny 's party . - Definitely no . Definitely no . My brother , Ned . I thought you might want a little cheering up . Ned , how sweet of you , how really sweet . I 'm a sweet kid . Take this back to the orchestra leader , please . My brother , Ned , Mr . and Mrs . Potter . Friends of Johnny 's . He used to live with us . We 've come to warn his future bride . He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste . Then we 'll drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? No , I 'm wrong . He does n't need it . Johnny 's doing all right . - What 's on your mind , Ned ? - Nothing 's on my mind . What do you mean , " Johnny 's doing all right ? " I mean he 's doing all right . He 's having a whirl . His hair 's slicked down and Father 's seeing that he meets the important people . My word , are there important people downstairs ? Frightfully important . That 's why I wanted to give a party up here . Miss Seton on New Year 's Eve entertained a group of very unimportant people . To our hostess . May I drink , too ? Believe it or not , I 've just been learning how much it costs to keep up a yacht . - What 's the matter ? - Father sent for me . It 's about Linda . Everybody has begun to talk about her not being here . - She 's simply got to come down . - Got to ? Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - I 'll ask her . - Insist on it . I 'll do what a gentleman can do under the circumstances . - That 's good . Was that good ? - No ! Yeah , marvellous . - Unless I 'm getting drunk . - No . It 's the first champagne I 've had since I was 4 . Not really ? - Do you mind if I play with your toys ? - I think you 'd better . - Thank you . - That 's all right . He 's grand . - Has Johnny any other friends like him ? - There are n't many people like Nick . Or like Johnny either , for that matter . - We 've had wonderful times , we three . - You 'll have a lot more fun with Julia . You must let Ned and me be guest members of the Johnny , Julia , Nick and Susan Club . Look what I 've found . Come on , let 's do Romeo and Juliet . " What light through yonder window breaks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . - Did you ? - This is a lovely one . - Do one for us . Go ahead . Come on , Neddie . It 's all complete , including the characters . You remember any of the lines ? Linda . Johnny , come in . - I have a message for you . - And I have a message for you . I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested downstairs . I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested right here . - There 's a meeting of the club . - Your club . No . Come on , the party needs you . Now 's the time to come to the aid of the party . But your father is really upset . Why , you do n't tell me . What seems to be the matter ? Everybody has begun to notice you 're not there and it 's embarrassing the family . The ... . Johnny -- Linda , be a good sport now . It will make your father awfully happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on my hands and knees ? That 's telling him . Oh , my . - That 's not Johnny . - No ? - Who is it ? - That 's a very important person . Hello , important person . Do n't be fresh . - Treat important persons with respect . - I won't . - Hello , important person . - Yeah ? Take your place . What is this ? It 's the voice of experience . Nick and Susan ! Sir , that lady is my wife . Nick , thank goodness you came . The face is familiar . But ... . Do we know anyone who smells of violet ? - How 's that , you dog . - No . It ca n't be . It 's Johnny Case . You remember him . John Case , the rail-splitter , friend of the people . Yes . - Well , we 're glad to have you back . - Back ? You mean the marble pillars got me . I 'm ready . I 'll go quietly . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got that off my mind . - Never forget it . There 's something I want you to know . - That deal I mentioned ? - The Seaboard thing ? - I think it 'll go through . - You do n't mean it ? There 's a very fair chance that I 'll be able to quit business next Saturday . So that you can go on the holiday ? Sure , Johnny 's Declaration of Independence . It 's all according to what a Boston crowd called Bay State Power does . - Maybe they 've done it already . - They 'll do it ! - Then let 's drink to Bay State Power . - No , let 's drink to Julia . - Have you met her yet ? - No . If she 's anything like her sister ... . No , we 'll drink to Johnny and Julia and Bay State Power , love and happiness and ... . Here you are . For the love of Pete , it 's The Witch and Dopey . I 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? We like it . Linda , are you aware that there 's another party going on in this house ? You mean that low-class dancehall downstairs ? Do n't speak of it . Excuse me , these are my friends . Professor and Mrs . Potter , Mr . and Mrs . Cram . How do you do ? You old fox , you . Fox ? Sam Hobson 's been telling me about your little haul in Seaboard . You might have let us in the family in on it . - There 's still time . - Not the way that stock 's acting . We have an order to buy 60,000 shares for Ross of Bay State Power all the way up to 30 . - Are you sure of that ? - I took the order myself . That cinches it . - Is that it ? - Just about . Good for you . Come on ! Good for you . Have lunch with me at the club on Tuesday . I think I could help you double your yield . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're probably joking , Professor . With the help of the right people in Wall Street you 'll make more within two years . It would n't take that long if we had the right kind of government . - Like which country for example , Mr . Cram ? - Now no political arguments . - Let 's go downstairs and celebrate . - Yes , this is a wonderful party . - I 'm not going downstairs . - Come on , do n't be foolish . - But , Linda , your father said -- - I thought so but I 'm not going downstairs . - Of course if -- - I would n't keep anyone who wants to . If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I 've seen . And has someone asked you ? Come , dear , we can discuss this later . You would n't care to swing on the trapeze and discuss it now , would you , Seton ? We shall see you later , Mrs . Porter . Professor Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrong . In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club . And present you , my dear boy , with this token of their affection and esteem . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Mr . Toastmaster , ladies and gentlemen . My friends . I am not much of a speechmaker , so I hardly know how to thank you . This young lady and myself have been practicing a few feats of acrobatic skill with which we shall be glad to entertain you . Alley . - Ready ? - Ready . Put on the lights . Uno momento . - Alley . - Oop . Linda . The club is adjourned . Julia , I 've got a grand surprise for you . Just a moment . Come down now . It 's nearly 12:00 and we want the entire party together to see the New Year in . The New Year comes into this room , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see the New Year in as I had planned , as I had asked you -- I think if you do n't mind we 'll go down and see what 's happened to the furnace . Julia , this is Nick and Susan . I told you about them . How do you do ? - And Mr . Seton . - Your friends are always welcome here . I 'll see you downstairs . Thank you , but as a matter of fact Susan has an awful run in her stocking . Why do n't you go down to my room ? It 's on the third floor . Fine . Congratulations on your engagement , Miss Seton . You 're not getting very much , but I 'm sure you can improve him . Kindly walk , do not run to the nearest exit . They 're grand people . - They 'll wait , do n't you think ? - I do n't know . I do n't know . There 's no cause for temper , child . Run along and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . Listen to me , Father , tonight means a good deal to me . I do n't know what or how precisely . Something 's trying to take it away and I ca n't let it go . I 'll put in an appearance downstairs . Then I want to bring those people back here . I want to sit and have supper with them . We wo n't disturb anyone . That 's all right with you , is n't it ? Your place is downstairs . Once more , this is important to me . Do n't ask me why . It has something to do with this room when I was a child and good times in it . What special virtue this room has I 'm sure I do n't know . You do n't , do you ? No , you ca n't . I 'll tell you , this room 's my home , it 's the only home I 've got . There 's something here that I understand and that understands me . - Maybe it 's Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . You thought I 'd come around . You always think people will come around . Not me , not tonight . And I sha n't be disturbed either ' cause if there 's one thing you hate , it 's a scene . I can promise you one if you interfere . I can promise you a beauty . Johnny , so there 's good news , is there ? Was Mother a sweet soul , Father ? Linda , if you 're not happy here why do n't you go away ? I 'll be glad if next month you take a maid and a companion and take a trip somewhere . You distress me . You cause nothing but trouble and upsets . That 's just what I 'm going to do . - No maid and no companion . Just me . - As you wish . I 've been dying to get out for years . I 've never known it so well as tonight . I ca n't stand it here any longer . It 's doing terrible things to me . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . This room . I do n't think you 'll be able to stand it long . I 'll come back when you 've left it . I do n't believe I need to worry about the way you 'll take care of Julia , need I ? We 'll try to manage , thanks , sir . Seton has told us of your very successful manipulations of Seaboard . I consider that a very fine piece of work . I congratulate you . Is n't it marvellous ? What a New Year . When you return from your honeymoon if I 'm not much mistaken there 'll be a desk waiting for you at the bank . That 's very kind of you , sir but the success of the Seaboard deal makes possible a certain plan of my own . But , Johnny ... . A plan ? Yes ? I 'm afraid I 'm not quite as anxious as I might be for the things most people work towards . I do n't want too much money . - Too much money ? - Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been my idea to make a few thousands early in the game and then quit for as long as it lasts and try to find out who I am and what goes on now , while I 'm young and feel good all the time . I 'm sure Julia understands what I 'm getting at , do n't you , Julia ? I 'm not sure I do , Johnny . You wish to occupy yourself otherwise , is that it ? Please do n't make me feel guilty about it . Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on . Even if I find I 've had enough of it in three months , I want it . If I let this chance go by , there 'll never be another for me so I do n't think anyone will mind if I just have a go at it , will they , Julia ? Will they , dear ? - Father , let Johnny and me talk awhile . - Just a moment . In all my experience -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise you . Case , it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this . A very strange time . - Father . - I see , sir . Then ... . Then perhaps -- Father , please go down . We 'll come in a minute . He did n't get what I was driving at , at all . Why did you do it ? You knew all that talk would antagonize him . - You think talk is all it was ? - I think it was less than that . I 'm furious with you . It was n't just talk , Julia . You do n't realize what Father is offering you . Wait a minute , dear . - We 'd better get clear on this . - I 'm clear on it right now . If you think you can persuade me that a man of your energy and your ability possibly could quit at 30 ... . If you 're tired and want a rest , why , we 'll have it . Have n't you the remotest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . But you have n't any idea yet of how exciting business can be . See it through . You 'll love it . I know you will . There 's no such thrill in the world as making money . Darling , you do n't see what I 'm aiming at either . Try a little blind faith for a while , wo n't you ? - Come along with me ? - But -- No , the whole way , dear . Johnny , wait till next year or two years and we 'll think about it again . You can do that for me , for us , ca n't you ? You think by then I 'd be a good sport and come around , that 's what you think , do n't you ? It lacks six minutes to the New Year if anyone 's interested . Come on , Johnny . Have Nick and Susan gone ? I do n't know . They were n't in my room . - Perhaps they 're downstairs . - Perhaps . Anyone care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is plain stubbornness and you know it . Listen , Julia . No , that gets you nowhere , does it ? Are you coming ? I think I 'll wait a moment with Linda if you do n't mind . But I do mind . Will you come , please ? In a moment , Julia . You 'd better run on down now , do n't you think ? Not right away . I 'm afraid I wo n't know how to entertain you . I 've done all my stuff . I do n't need entertaining . You would n't care to step into a waltz as the old year dies , would you , Mr . Case ? Yes , I would . I 'd love it . There 's a conspiracy against you and me , child . What 's that ? - The vested interests . - I know . They wo n't let you have any fun and they wo n't give me time to think . I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Poor boy . What about your own evening ? Not so hot either . Poor girl . - Of course , they may be right . - Do n't you believe it . I do n't know . They seem so awfully sure . It 's still your ride , is n't it ? You know where you want to go , do n't you ? - I thought I did . - So did I . Pathetic , was n't it , all my fuss and fury over anything as unimportant as this party . Maybe it is important . Well , if it is , I 'm not , and I guess that 's the answer . Linda , you 're so sweet . Thanks , that 's enough . It was grand . Listen . That 's it , all right . Happy New Year , Johnny . Happy New Year , Linda . You can count on sister Linda , Johnny . Run on down now . They 'll be waiting . Linda . What ? They 've ... . - Your father put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Julia ? Of course I do . Well , if ever she needed you , she needs you now . You 're all that 's left . Go on , Johnny . Happy New Year . Same to you . - What 's it like to get drunk , Ned ? - It 's ... . How drunk ? Good and drunk . Grand . How is it ? Well , to begin with it brings you to life . Does it ? And after a while you begin to know all about it . You feel , I do n't know , important . That must be good . It is . And then pretty soon the game starts . What game ? A swell game , a terribly exciting game . You think clear as crystal but every move , every sentence is a problem . That gets pretty interesting . - You get beaten though , do n't you ? - Sure , but that 's good , too . Then you do n't mind anything , not anything at all . Then you sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . As long as you last . Ned , that 's awful . Think so ? Other things are worse . Where do you end up ? Where does everybody end up ? You die . And that 's all right , too . Ned , can you do it on champagne ? Why ? What 's the matter , Linda ? Nothing . - I know . - Yes ? Johnny . Give me some more wine , Ned . - He 's in a spot , is n't he ? - Give me some , Ned . You can tell me about it , dear . I love the boy , Neddie . I thought so . Great , is n't it ? Great . Here 's luck to you . I do n't want any luck . Ladies and gentlemen , my good friends , I have the honour to announce to you the engagement of my daughter Julia to Mr . John Case . An event which doubles the pleasure I take in wishing you and them a most happy and prosperous New Year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Are n't you thrilled ? Is n't it -- - I am . - I 'm sure you 'll be very happy . - You 're thinking of my sister . - What ? - Not I ! My sister . Linda , now you must get married yourself . - Thank you . - I 'm so happy for you . Thank you for coming down . You must go back to bed . The doctor said you should n't excite yourself . What is this ? Where 's the lucky boy ? I have n't seen the lucky boy since the announcement . - Linda , did you know about it ? - Of course I did . - Where is he ? - That 's something I would n't know . I do n't know . He wanted to argue with Father . He did n't make sense . He said things to Father he had no right to say . Then after the announcement to go downstairs and leave us . It 's horrible . Please do n't be so upset . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine . Of all times -- - Linda , is n't it too marvellous ? - Too , too marvellous . I 'll ... . - Linda , now you must get married . - I hope I shall . Linda needs to find a husband . - Hello . It is wonderful , is n't it ? - It 's simply lovely . - Hello . How 's Baltimore ? - It 's fine , thank you . - Have you seen Mr . Case anywhere ? - Mr . Case went through here a moment ago . Through there ? - Did Mr . Case come in here ? - Yes , ma'am , right through here , ma'am . " Happy New Year , " he says . Congratulations to Miss Julia , ma'am . Thank you . - Linda . Come in . - Hello , Susan . I 'm sorry to butt in . Well , as I live . Look , it 's the acrobat lady . - Glad to see you . - Glad to see you , too . Run to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to call . - The phone 's been discontinued . We pay our bills . It 's that we 're planning a little trip . - You 're sailing ? - Tonight . Come on in and help us pack . The university gave me leave to work in France . And we 're doing our best ... . You ought to have some tea or something . You look peaked . I 've been hunting for Johnny . I thought he 'd be here . Have you seen him ? Not since that night . - You knew he walked out . - Yes . He came here and we talked until New Year 's noon . Then he left town to think things over . - His letter said he 'd be back today . - Then I can see him ! He 's probably on his way . Has n't your sister heard from him ? If she has , she has n't told me . - You love her a great deal , do n't you ? - Yes . A lot of good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your father does -- Johnny 'll fix that . Johnny 'll fix everything . If I could only make Julia and Father listen to me . I 've got to . Johnny 's so sweet , he 's so attractive . What 's the matter with the girl anyway ? She ought to know by now that men like Johnny do n't grow on every bush . Linda , is n't it just possible that the things we like in Johnny may be the very things she ca n't stand ? The fate that you feel he 'll save her from is the one fate in this whole world she wants ? I do n't believe that . Even so , she loves him and there 's been a break . Would n't you think she 'd be woman enough to hang on ? Yes , if she loves him . Julia has never in her life loved anyone but Johnny . - Perhaps herself . - That 's not true . Even in this , it 's of him she 's thinking , she may be mistaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a girl in love feels . - We 're sorry , Linda , really . - No , you 're not . You 're ... . What 's the matter with me anyway ? Even if I told you what was the matter with you , you would n't admit it . - I do n't know what you 're talking about . - Pay no attention to her . If you did anything else then you would n't be what you are . Which to my professorial mind is head of the class . - I love you two . - And so do we love you . In our rough , uncouth way , of course . - Johnny is seeing your sister this afternoon . - Yes ? He 's asking her to sail with us and with him tonight . - What do you think she 'll say ? - Yes . What if she does n't ? What happens then ? What 's Johnny to do ? What would you want him to do ? That may be he . Nicholas Porter ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Thanks . Julia will sail , she must , she 's got to . Good-bye . Julia . Hello , dear . You 'll be late for the Todds ' dinner , wo n't you ? You had luncheon with Johnny . He wants you to sail tonight . - You 've seen him ? - The Potters told me . You must sail with him . - The Potters ? Who are the Potters ? - Stop it , Julia . - Stop what ? - Pretending you do n't care . You 're taking my little difficulty more seriously than I am . Do n't let Johnny go off tonight and make a hash of both your lives . You ca n't let him sail alone . He 's no more sailing than you are . Does Father know you are n't going to the Todds ' dinner ? Why do you want to shut me out in the cold like this ? I was n't aware that I was . Wo n't you just talk to me ? Please , Julia . If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done it . Me ? Johnny and I have had a difference and you 're siding with him , are n't you ? But he 's right . - He 's right for you as well as for himself . - I think that 's for me to decide . - Not Father ? - Father has nothing to do with it . He happens to agree with me where you do n't . But ... . But we 've always agreed before , always . No . I think quite often I 've given in , in order to avoid scenes and upsets and ... . Is that true , Julia ? You 've always been the stronger character . At least people have always thought so . You 've made the decisions and had the ideas . And you 've been resenting me . I ca n't believe it . It 's nothing to get into a stew about . I did n't say I resented you . You 've been an immense help often . When it comes to determining my future and the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Julia ? What do you want , just security ? Sit back smugly in your bank vault among the worthies of the world ? One thing I do n't want is to start this endless discussion all over again . You 've only 20 minutes in which to dress . Linda , did you hear me ? Father , I think you 're both giving Johnny the rottenest kind of a deal . - In what way ? - In every way . - You 're not thinking of what 's best for him . - On the contrary . The young man 's outlook has merely become somewhat confused . - You 'll straighten it out for him . - We shall try . But why has n't he the right to live part of his life as he wants to ? Linda , I should like to understand what he and you are aiming at but I confess , I can not . I consider his whole attitude un-American . - Are you serious ? - Entirely . Then he is and he wo n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life devoted to piling up money is all it 's cracked up to be . Strange , is n't it , when he has us right before his eyes for such a shining example ? I listened most attentively the other day to our young dreamer and I still must confess that the talk of the two of you seems to me of the 17-year-old variety . I 'm glad if it is . We 're grand at 17 . It 's after that , that sickness sets in . Well , I feel very well myself . You both think he 'll come around . Compromise , anyway . You 'll get fooled . He wo n't give way one inch . - Stubborn ? - No , right and knows he 's right . What 's the matter , kid ? I ca n't believe it , Ned . Johnny 's clearing out . He 's sailing tonight and Julia wo n't lift a finger to stop him . I do n't understand her . Most people , including Johnny and yourself , make a big mistake about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At bottom she 's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in . You 've just never hit it off , that 's all . - Ned . - What ? You remember what we talked about on New Year 's Eve ? Sure , I remember . - Tell me something . - Sure . Does it stand out all over me ? Why ? Nick and Susan , this afternoon . I think they got it . Anyone who loves you would , Linda . That 's awful . I 'm so ashamed . I 'm not , though . Why should you be ? Pardon me , Miss Linda . - Yes , Henry . - Mr . Case is downstairs . Have him come up , will you , Henry ? And , Henry , tell Miss Julia . He 'll be up in a minute . Are you sure you want to get over him ? No , I 'm not and that 's what scares me most . I feel alive and I love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it ca n't get anywhere so it 's like living on that stuff . - I 've got to get over it . - Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ? Seems ? What do you mean ? Do n't you know ? Let me tell you something . You 're twice as attractive as Julia ever thought of being . You 've got twice the looks , twice the mind and 10 times the quality . You could charm a bird off a tree if you would and why not ? If you were in her way she 'd ride you down like a rabbit . How could you , Ned , knowing the way she loves him ? - How could you ? - All right , Linda . Tell him hello for me , will you ? - Hello , Linda . - Hello , Johnny . I sent for Julia . I feel as if I 'd been away quite a while . Yeah . - I went to Placid . - I see . It was ... . - It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to take that job at the bank . - I see . Only for a while , only for a couple of years . Just until I can get it through to her that ... . It was what she asked and after all , a couple of years is n't a lifetime . - Is it ? - Of course not . - I think everything will be all right , Johnny . - Sure . I can see the way they feel about it . I could hardly expect them to do a complete , sudden about-face but ... . But , hang it , why ca n't they see what I 'm getting at ? Perhaps eventually they will . That 's what I 'm counting on . Linda you agree there 's only one thing for me to do now , do n't you ? Compromise ? Yes . Yes . You think that 's right , do n't you ? - I do n't think it matters a bit what I think . - It does though , Linda . You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's right . Johnny , when two people love each other as much as you do anything that keeps them apart must be wrong . - Good evening . - Good evening , sir . They tell me you 've been away . Pleasant having you back . It 's pleasant to be back . There 's been a rather noticeable absence of snow these recent weeks . Quite . Father , Johnny came tonight to see Julia . That does n't surprise me a great deal , Daughter , not a great deal . Julia , not you and me . Come on , Dada , let 's go bye-bye . Good evening , Johnny . - Get your coat , darling , we 're going out . - Yes , dear . Father , could you explain to the Todds ? Please , close the door . I wish to speak with you both . You insist on putting me into a position that I do n't in the least relish . Who 's there ? Come in , Ned . - Sorry . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Son . Coming between two young people in love is furthest from my wish or intention . For love , true love , is a very rare and beautiful thing . Where are you going ? Please , sit down . And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love , contrary to the adage , should run smooth . I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation . It is of paramount importance -- - I beg your pardon , sir ? - Yes ? If that position at the bank is still open I 'll be glad to take it . I 'm still not convinced . I still do n't believe in it , but it 's what Julia wishes and ... . And I 'm glad to defer to her wish . - You 're not convinced , you say ? - Would you like me to lie to you , sir ? Father , it 's enough for me . Julia said a year or two . I 'll do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only one reservation . If , at the end of that time , I still think it 's wise for me to quit ... - ... there wo n't be any objections . - I doubt there 'll be reason for any . We shall have to see about that . Well , Father ? - When is it you wish to be married ? - As soon as possible . Now the sun shines once more and we 're all friends again . And now what are your plans for your wedding trip , may I ask ? - We have n't any definite -- - It 's wise to prearrange honeymoons . Now let me suggest a little itinerary . You will land at Plymouth or Southampton and proceed straight to London . I shall cable my sister tomorrow . They will be delighted to have you stay with them . He is one of the most important men in British banking circles . You could scarcely go abroad and not stop with your Aunt Helen , Julia . In addition it will save hotel expenses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable the Bovays in Paris . He 's expert adviser to the Minister of Finance . A valuable man for you to know . I had thought of this as a honeymoon more than a business trip , sir . There 's no harm in combining a little business with pleasure . I 've never found there was . They have a lovely place , Johnny , just outside of Paris . Now a week in London , a week in Paris , 10 days in the South of France , ideal . Then you could sail from Genoa and return by southern route . I 'll arrange to have your house ready for you March 1 . Thanks , darling . What house is that , Julia ? Father 's lending us a place on 64th Street . Wait till you see it . This is not to be a gift you know , not yet . After you 've occupied it for some time my hard old heart may soften . Listen to him , his hard old heart . Would you also arrange for the servants ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Would you mind telling me what you mean ? I thought this was a trial for a couple of years . If we begin with possessions and obligations we could never get out from under them . No ! No . You 've been extremely kind and generous , but it 's not for us . - But you ... . You said that -- - I 'm back where I was , Julia . I can see now it 's got to be a clean break , it 's simply got to . We 've got to make our own life , there 's nothing to it if we do n't . There 's no other way to live it . Forget about wedding invitations and all the rest of it . Let 's get married tonight . - I must decide now , must I ? - Please . And if I say no ? I 'm going tonight by myself . Very well then . You can go . I suppose the fact is I love feeling free even better than I love you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make a go of it . Thanks for trying anyway . Good-bye to you , Linda . You 've been sweet . Good-bye , Johnny . I hope you find what you 're looking for . I hope you do . Linda . Please , do . Good-bye , Ned . I 'll miss that man . He 's gone . - Yes , and in my opinion -- - Good riddance . - He 's really gone . - Never mind . He loves you , he 'll be back . Be back ? " Be back , " did you say ? What do you think I am ? I hope this experience , hard as it may have been -- Do n't worry about me . I 'm all right . Even a little more than all right , I should say . - What 's with you ? Will you kindly -- - You do n't love him . Answer me . Do you or not ? - What 's that to you ? - You do n't , do you ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . - Suppose I am ? - She asks me , suppose she is ! - Are you ? Say it . - I 'm so relieved I could sing with it . - Is that what you want ? - Yes , thanks . Neddie , Neddie , have I got a job now . Is your passport in order ? Mine is . What do you say ? - Well , when ? - Now . Tonight . - I do n't think I could . - Sure you could . If I can , you can . - Where are you off to ? - Will you come ? - Where are you going ? - On a trip . On a big ride . Do you mind ? Will you come , Ned ? - Listen , Father -- - A trip now is out of the question . - You won't . - Can't . - Caught ? - Maybe . - I 'll be back for you , Ned . - I 'll be here . You 've got no faith in Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you think . What if it should ? There will be another . I 've got faith in Johnny . Whatever he does is all right with me . If he wants to dream for a while , he can and if he wants to come back and sell peanuts , how I 'll believe in those peanuts . Good-bye , Julia . Good-bye , Father . - Good-bye , Neddie . - Good-bye , kid . Good luck . Never you fear , I 'll be back for you , my fine bucko . All right . Linda . Try and stop me , someone . Please someone try and stop me . I shall not permit it . I shall ... . - Permit Linda ? Do n't make me laugh . - She 's going with him , is n't she ? Is n't she ? - Going to get her Johnny . - A fine chance she 's got . Any bets ? Any bets , Julia ? To Linda . And while we 're at it , Grandfather . Dear , what a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please stop it , Nick ? I ca n't stop it , Susan . I 'm miserable . Thinking of him I should say . - Shut up , dearest . - For two cents , I 'd call off the whole thing . - Johnny . - Johnny . My word . - Where 's Julia ? - I left her sitting on her golden throne . - Johnny is taking the big ride by himself . - No . Boy , champagne , any amount of it , but hurry . - Oui , Monsieur Porter . - The name is Potter . Let 's change our name to Porter . Then they 'll call us Potter . What happened ? I 've just wakened out of a nightmare . Everything will be all right . I know it is . Come on , children , come on . Is this where the club meets ? Right here .

You 're the most contemptible person I 've ever met in all my life Confidentially , I think you 're a bit of a stinker , too . If we get to Basle on time , we 'll see the last day of the match . Hope the weather 's like this in Manchester . Perfect wicket for our fellas . - Is n't it some where here ? - If You Do n't Hurry , Margaret , or we sha n't get a compartment to ourselves .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batting . - What do you mean ? I do nt understand - I 'll show you . Look Here I saw the whole thing . Now then , there 's Hammond , there 's the bowler , there 's the umpire . - Sugar ? - Two , please . Dear me , there is no sugar . Watch this very very carefully , Caldicott . Grimmet was bowling . May I trouble you for the sugar , please ? - What ? - The sugar , please . Thank you so much . If I were you , I 'd try and get a little sleep . It 'll make you feel well . There 's an intriguing acrostic in The Needlewoman . I 'm going to try and unravel it before you wake up . Reservations for lunch , please . - Madam has booked for lunch ? - My friend did , she 's got the ticket . - Have you seen my friend ? - No ? Erm , my friend , where is she ? La signora inglese , the English lady , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . - What ? - There has been no English lady here . - There has . She sat there , in the corner . You saw her , you spoke to her . She sat next to you . Ridiculous , She took me to the dining car and came back here with me . You went and came back alone . May be you do nt understand , I mean the lady who looked after me when I was knocked out . Ah , perhaps it make-a you forget , eh ? I may be very dense , but if this is some part of a joke , I 'm afraid I do n't see the point . - Oh , Steward , you served me tea just now - Yes , madam . - Have you seen the lady I was with ? english lady ? - But madam was alone . - Pardon , he make mistake . - Well ofcourse , He must remember the little English lady . - She ordered the tea and paid for it . - It is you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - but She gave you a special packet of tea . you can't forgot me that - The tea was ours madam , but I receive no packet . - But you did.I know what happened . - Pardon , madam , the bill . - Er , tea for one . - But that 's not right . Perhaps madam would examine the bills ? No , the whole thing 's too absurd . Please , have you seen a lady pass through ... ? Oh . Well , if it is n't old stinker If I thought you 'd be on this train , I 'd have stayed another week in the hotel . - Er , lady , no , why ? - Does n't matter . You probably would n't recognise one anyway . Hello ? Feeling queer ? It 's that pipe of yours . Why do n't you throw your old socks away ? Thanks for the help . - Oh Come on , sit down , Take it easy what 's the trouble ? - You must know Something fell on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . - Bad luck . Can I help ? - Only by going away . Noo NO No . My father always taught me , never desert a lady in trouble . He even went as far as marrying mother . - Did you see a lady last night in hotel in tweeds ? - I saw one lady , hardly in tweeds . - She was in my compartment.i couldn't find her - She must be still on the train.We have n't stopped yet - Of course.Still on the train I know that . - All right . Nobody said she isn't . - That 's just what they are saying . - Who ? The people in the compartment and the stewards . - All of them ? - All of them . - You said you got a knock on the head ? - What do you mean ? - Never mind . Do you talk the lingo ? - No . They probably thought you wanted money . Let 's knock the idea out of their stupid heads . Unfortunate remark , I beg your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark man . I say , Excuse me , there 's been a misunderstanding . This young lady has lost her friend . yes , I have heard . This gentleman has been explaining to me . Most interesting . - I think under circumstances , we shall all introduce ourselves . - I am Italian citizen . - My wife and child . - How do you do . Bonny chap , how old ? 1934 . And the lady in the corner is the Baroness Attorna . Yes . I met her husband.He presented crisis at the folk dance festival . Minister of Propaganda . I am Dr Egon Hartz of Prague . You may have heard of me . - The brain specialist ? - The same . You flew to England and operated on a cabinet minister . - Yes . - Did you find anything ? - A slight cerebral contusion . - that's Better than nothing . I am picking up a similar case at the next station.so much more complicated I shall operate at the hospital tonight . A cranial fracture with compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beam . - I suppose You have n't seen my friend ? - Unfortunately No . I 'll just take a word with the baroness . - Scusi , avete visto la signora ? - No . Non I'ha vista . - What do they say ? - They say that they 've never seen her . - But that was n't true , she was sitting where you are . - Can you describe her ? But that 's difficult you see , She was sort of middle age . - What was she wearing ? - Tweeds . Oatmeal , flecks of brown , a three-quarter coat with patch pockets , a scarf , felt hat , brown shoes , a tussore shirt and a small , blue handkerchief in her breast pocket . - I ca n't remember any more . - You were n't paying attention ! - You both went along to tea ? - Yes . - Surely you met somebody ? - I suppose we did , but ... Wait .. let me think . There was an Englishman who passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig him out . - I come with you . This is more interesting to me We do n't like people muscling in but we 'll make you a member . Wait , when passed this compartment Miss Froy stumbled in There was a tall gentleman and a lady . Alrite , Now we are getting some , If we can find someone who saw her , we 'll search the place . - Can I be of assistance ? - That 's the gentlemen Do you remember seeing this lady pass here with a little English woman ? I 'm , er , I 'm afraid not . But you must have . She almost fell into your compartment . It 's very important . Everybody 's saying she was n't on the train but I know she is . I 'm going to find her , even if I have to stop the train to do it . Caldicott , this is Charters , can I come in ? That girl we saw at the hotel is kicking up a devil of a fuss . - Says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here . - She threatens to stop the train . - Oh , Lord . If we miss our connection , we wo n't make Manchester in time . - This is serious . - Let 's hide in here . Sorry , I have n't the faintest recollection . You must be making a mistake . Well , He obviously does n't remember . Let 's go and look for the other fellow . Who were you talking to , outside ? Oh , nobody . Just , er , some people in the corridor , arguing . - There he is . That 's the man . - Oh , I wonder if I could bother you ? - I wonder if you can help ? - How ? I was having tea with an English lady . You saw her ? did n't you - I do n't know , I was talking to my friend . - Indubitably . Yes , You were sitting in the next table She turned and borrowed the sugar . - You must remember . - I recall passing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discussing cricket . I do n't see how a thing like cricket can make you forget . If that 's your attitude , obviously there 's nothing more to say . Come , Caldicott . Thing like cricket ! We should have said we were looking for a lost cricket ball . - yes , but he spoke to her , There must be some explanation . - There is . Please forgive me , iam quite possibly be wrong , but I have known cases where a sudden shock or blow - has induced a most vivid impression . - I understand . - You do n't believe me . - It 's not a question of belief . Even a concussion may have curious effects upon an imaginative person . Yes , But I can remember every little detail . Her name , Miss Froy , everything . So interesting . you know If one had time , one could trace the cause of the hallucination . - Hallucination ? - oh ! Precisely . There is no Miss Froy , there was n't Miss Froy merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night at the hotel . - You thought you did . - But what about the name ? - Some past association , an advertisement or a character in a novel , subconsciously remembered . There is no reason to be frightened , if you are quiet and relax . Thank you very much . If you will excuse me , this is where my patient comes aboard . Excuse me . Most interesting . - Stopping . - This is the first stop , is n't it ? - Mm-hm . - oh then Miss Froy must still be on the train . you Look out of this window and see if she gets off this side . I 'll take the other . Most interesting . - What was she dressed in , Scotch tweeds ? - Oatmeal tweeds . I knew it had something to do with porridge . How long does it take to get a divorce ? - Eric ? - I-I beg your pardon . I was n't listening . - I said how long does it take to get a divorce ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could take our honeymoon next spring . - I mean , the official one . - The difficulties are considerable . but , one thing The courts are very crowded just now . Although we barristers ought not to complain about that . With conditions as they are now , my chances of becoming a judge are rosy . That is , if nothing untoward occurs . Such as you being mixed up in a divorce case . - Yes In that first careless rapture , you said did n't care what happened . The law , like Caesar 's wife , must be above suspicion . Even when the law spends six weeks with Caesar 's wife ? - Look here Now I know why you 've been running around like a scared rabbit . - Why you lied a few minutes ago . - I lied ? Yes , to those people in the corridor . I heard every word you said . merely , I did n't wish to be mixed up in any inquiry . Inquiry ! Just because a little woman ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman had disappeared and I 'd admitted having seen her , we might become vital witnesses . My name might appear in the papers , coupled with yours . A scandal like that might lead anywhere . - Anywhere . - Yes . I suppose it might . - Nobody ? - Nobody . All that came out my side was two bits of orange peel and a paper bag . I know there 's a Miss Froy . She 's real as you are That 's what you saying , I believe it but does nt appear nobody else has seen her . I saw her , I think . You did ? - A little woman in tweeds wearing 3 quarter clothes - With a scarf ? - that's rite - I saw her with you when you passed the compartment - I knew I was right . - But Your husband said he had n't seen her . - He did n't notice but as soon as he mentioned it I remembered at once You win . This calls for action . Would you make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Pardon , my patient has just arrived.most fascinating complication We 've some news . This lady actually saw Miss Froy . - So We shall have the train searched . - You like to think a fresh theory . doctor ? It is n't not Necessary , My theory was perfectly good one . The facts were misleading . - I hope you find your friend . Excuse me . - I 'll be in here if you want me Right you are . Come along . Eric . I was only going to mention that i told that girl that I 'd seen her friend . - Have you taken leave of your senses ? - On the contrary . I 've come to them . - What do you mean ? - If there 's scandal , there 'd be a divorce . You could n't let me down.could you You will have to do the decent thing , - as reluctantly as only you know how . - You forget one important thing , Margaret . Your husband would divorce you but whatever happens my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to search the train . Ah , signorina ... Your friend , she come back . - Come back ? - S ? , s ? . - But what happened ? - You go see . She tell you . Scusi . Thanks . All right , relax , the crisis is over . come on , Let 's join the lady . - Here we are . - Miss Froy . - That is n't Miss Froy . - Is n't it ? - No . - It 's silly to say but are you Miss Froy ? No . I am Madam Kummer . She helped you into the carriage , then went to see some friends . As you spoke of the English lady , she did n't connect her with Madam Kummer . But she was n't the lady i saw . It was Miss Froy . - Oatmeal tweeds , blouse ... - yes I know , everything 's the same - but it is n't her . beg your pardon - When did you meet Miss Froy ? - Last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume like this ? - Yes , I think so . - Then I must apologise . You did meet her . - Then ... - But not on this train . In your subconscious , you substituted Miss Froy for Madam Kummer . but I did n't . I could n't have actually I talked to her here . An English lady saw her . If this lady would n't mind ... Bon , apr ? s vous , madame . What a gift for languages the fellow 's got . Would you tell us , is this the woman you saw ? It is n't a bit like her , is it ? - Yes , she 's the woman . - It is n't , I tell you . Are you sure ? - Perfectly . - She is n't , she is n't . Come on , then . I 'm so sorry to have troubled you . Well ? Are n't you going to say anything ? - You might at least gloat , if nothing else . - You only did it to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in her face . They 're all lying , but why ? Why do n't you sit down ? take it easy Do you think I substituted Miss Froy 's face for Madam Kummer 's ? - I think a change 'd be an improvement . - Miss Froy was on this train and nothing will convince me otherwise . Must you follow me round like a pet dog ? Let 's say a watchdog , I 've got all the better instincts . Goodbye . The doctor was right , I never saw Miss Froy on the train . I 'm glad you 're gon na take it like that . Forget all about it . Make your mind a complete blank . Watch me , you ca n't go wrong . - What about something to eat ? - Anything . - that's rite come along Would you like a little air ? - Thanks . - Can you eat anything ? - I could try . - that's the spirit You 'll feel a different girl tomorrow . - I hope so . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your what ? I 'm being married on Thursday . - Quite sure you 're not imagining that ? - Positive . Oh , I was afraid so . Ah , food . - I could n't face it . - Mind if I talk with my mouth full ? - If you must . - Care to hear about my early life ? - I do n't think so . - Well then , I 'll begin with my father . you know It 's remarkable how many great men began with their father . Drink ? - A cup of tea , please . My father was a very colourful character and he was strongly addicted to ... You 'll never guess ? - Harriman 's Herbal Tea . - No ! Double scotch . - A million Mexicans drink it . - Maybe but Father did n't . Miss Froy gave the waiter a packet of it . - A packet of what ? - Harriman 's Herbal Tea . We agreed you 'd make your mind a complete blank . - But it 's so real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did we not ? We did . Sorry . Go on telling me about your father . My father was a very remarkable man . - Did he play the clarionet ? - He did . He never put it down unless it was absolutely necessary . I could n't help inheriting his love of music . - Why not ? - It was all he left me . You know , you 're remarkably attractive . Has anyone ever told you ? We were discussing you . - Yes , of course . Do you like me ? - Not much . After I 'd paid my father 's debts , I started to travel , until they tried to cash the cheques . I 'm writing a book now . Would you like to buy a copy ? I 'd love to . When will it be out ? About four years . - That 's a very long time . - It 's a very long book . Do you know why you fascinate me ? I 'll tell you . You have got two qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all and you 're always seeing things . - What 's the matter ? - Look . - It 's gone ! - What 's gone ? Miss Froy 's name on the window . you saw it You must have seen it ! She is on the train Now , steady , steady . We 've got to find her . Something 's happening to her . Stop the train . Listen everybodyThere 's a woman on this train - Miss Froy . They 're hiding her somewhere . I appeal to you to stop the train . Please help me . Make them stop the train . Why do n't you do something before it 's too late ? - Please . - You think I 'm crazy but I 'm not . For heaven 's sake Stop this train ! Leave me alone . - Leave me alone ! Huh ! Ten minutes late thanks to that fool of a girl . She gets up to any more tricks , we 'll be too late for the match . - I suppose you could n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't vanish and so forth . - She has . - What ? Vanished . - Who ? - The old dame . - Yes . - Well . - Well , how could she ? - What ? - Vanish . - I do n't know . That explains my point . People do n't disappear into thin air . - It 's done in India . - What ? - The rope trick . - Oh , that . It never comes out in a photograph . Look , in half an hour we 'll stop at Morshkan , just before the border . I will leave there with my patient for the National Hospital . If you come with me , you can stay overnight in a private ward . - You need rest . - Sorry , nothing doing . Is n't there anything we can do ? Yes . Find Miss Froy . I tell you , if she does not rest , I will not answer for her . You persuade her , she likes you . I 'm as popular as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , she may swallow it . Cosmopolitan trains . People of all nations . I 've just seen at least a million Mexicans in the corridor . I thought I 'd look in to tell you to think over what Dr Hartz said . If you fell like changing your mind , I 'll be hanging around . - What 's all the mystery ? - Miss Froy is on this train . I 've just seen that packet of tea in the rubbish . - She may be dead now . - Dead or ... For sheer variety , give me an English summer ... We 'll search the train . There 's something definitely queer here . Looks like a supply service for trunk murderers . Look at that ! - All right , Miss Froy , it 's only us . - Hurry up . Perhaps it 's Miss Froy bewitched ! I refuse to be discouraged . Faint heart never found old lady . - Do you know anything about her ? - No . Only that she was a governess going back home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might be something down here . - What on earth ... ? - Our Italian friend . I 've got it ! Wait a minute . There you are , the Great Doppo . - His visiting card , look . - What 's it say ? Magician , illusionist , mind-reader see his fascinating act , the vanishing ... lady . - The vanishing lady ? - Perhaps that 's the explanation . - What ? - He 's practising on Miss Froy . - Perhaps it 's a publicity stunt . - No . What about the Baroness and Madame Kummer ? - What 's your theory ? - I do n't know . My theory ? I 'll tell you . Oh , dear ! I ca n't get ... - Where are you ? - In here . With a smell of camphor ball . - I ca n't see you . - I 'm about somewhere . - Here I am . Where are you ? - I do n't know . This is what comes of not saying abracadabra . - Ooh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , out of it . - Not much . - Come and sit down . - What is that ? In magic circles , we call it the disappearing cabinet . - You get inside and you vanish . - So I noticed . You were about to tell me of your theory . Oh , my theory . Well ... my theory , my dear Watson , is that we are in very deep waters indeed . - Ahem . - Oh ! Thank you very much . Let us marshal our facts over a pipe full of shag . A little old lady disappears , everyone who saw her insists she was never there , right ? - Right . - We know that she was , therefore they did see her and so are lying . - Why ? - I do n't know . I 'm only Watson . Do n't bury yourself in the part . They dare n't face an enquiry as Miss Froy 's still on this train . - I told you that hours ago . - Yes , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Ooh , thank you . only onething we got to do we must search the train in disguise . - As what ? Well , er ... - English gentleman . - They 'd see through you . Perhaps you 're right . Aha ! Will Hay . Now , boys , boys , which of you has stolen Miss Froy ? Own up ! - Give those glasses to me . - Why ? - They 're Miss Froy's . - Are you sure ? Yes . Where did you find them ? - Down here . The glass is broken . - Probably in the struggle . Do you realise that this is our first piece of tangible proof ? That 's the lot . Will you please give me those spectacles ? They belong to me . Please . - Are you sure ? - Datemi questi occhiali ! Naughty , naughty . That 's a large nose for a small pair of spectacles . That 's the game , is it ? We 'll see about that . They 're Froy 's glasses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that too . Do n't stand there hopping about , kick him , see if he 's got a false bottom . Hang on , I 'll get him up . Ow ! That does n't help . Quick , pull his ears back . Give them a twist . Now I 've got him . He 's got a knife . Get hold of it before he cuts a slice off me . I ca n't reach it . Aah ! Well done , that 's it . That 's it . We know how that thing works , come out of there . Is he out ? We 've got to hide him somewhere . - What 's in here ? - Hurry up , quick , before he comes to . It 's empty . We can lock it . Come on . - Oh , no , you don't . - What 's the matter ? Garlic . I 'll be all right in a minute . - Here , let 's tie him up . - Oh , yes . So we definitely know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here had something to do with it . That ought to keep him quiet till we find her . Hard work but worth it . Let 's have the evidence . - Evidence ? - The glasses . - You 've got them . - No , I have n't got them . - Oh ! - He 's got them . He is n't there ! Snookered ! It 's a false bottom . - The twister ! He 's a contortionist . - He 's gone . To find the others . We ca n't fight the whole train , we need allies . - But who can we trust ? - That 's the snag . There 's that Dr Hartz person . Yes , you 're right . Let 's show him the symptoms . Oh , wait a minute . This is the one . He 's not there . Listen ... I 've just had a particularly idiotic idea . - I can believe that . - Supposing that patient is Miss Froy . It did n't come on the train till after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , let 's find the doctor . - No , wait a minute . - What is it ? Notice anything wrong about that nun ? - No . I do n't think she 's a nun , they do n't wear high heels . Yes , you 're right . Did you see Madame Kummer get on the train ? - No . - Well ... supposing they decoyed Miss Froy into the luggage van and hid her , the first stop , a patient comes aboard , all wrapped up , the patient is Madame Kummer , she becomes Miss Froy , Miss Froy becomes that . But why go to all this trouble to kidnap a harmless governess ? Maybe it is n't a governess at all . Perhaps it 's some political thing . Let 's investigate . Parlez vous fran ? ais ? Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? You 'll just have to cope with English . Can we look at your patient ? Thank you . Keep an eye on the nun . What are you doing here ? Why are you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no business to be here . leave her view Dr Hartz , we want you to Undo bandages and to look at your patient 's face . Are you out of your senses ? There is no face there . Nothing but lumps of raw flesh . that is the case He has lost so much blood only a transfusion can save him . - Do You want me to murder my patient ? - You 're sure this is your patient ? - We believe it 's Miss Froy . - Miss Froy ! You ca n't be serious ? Whatever put such ideas into your head ? - I understand she 's deaf and dumb . - But she may lip-read . It 's possible . In that case , perhaps you 'll join me in the dining car . I 'll be with you in a moment , I want to be sure my patient has n't been disturbed . How do I know how they cottoned on ? Somebody must have tipped ' em off . You never said the old girl was English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments I shall order three drinks in the dining car . Mine will be chartreuse . One of the stewards is working for us , now , listen.carefully There 's that girl again . Seems to have recovered . Lucky it blew over . Now , tell me what this is all about . Have you ever seen your patient ? No . I just had a message to operate at Morshkan . - How do you know it 's not Miss Froy ? - We believe it 's a substitution . - You really think ... that someone else - tararar umm ... Oh , I want a green chartreuse . - Wo n't you join me ? - Thanks . A large brandy . - And you ? - I do n't want anything . - Come on . - No , really . It 'll pick you up . All right , just a small one . Two brandies and a chartreuse . Do you know anything about the nun who 's looking after your patient ? Nun ! , No , only that she 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's peculiar that she 's wearing high-heeled shoes . Oh , is she ? That is rather curious , is n't it ? It 's a conspiracy . All these people on the train say they have n't seen Miss Froy but they have .. , we know that , because just now in the luggage van .. She 's off again . Hope she does n't create another scene . Put the lid on our getting back in time . ... and then this fella Doppo came and grabbed the glasses . Yeah , we had a bit of a fight . - Oh , a fight ? - We knocked him out . Oh ! - He 's made a speedy recovery . - Yes . All that 's just bluff . - Here . - Grazie . How could he be involved in a conspiracy ? Look at the poor fellow , he 's just a harmless traveller . - He 's also a music-hall artist on tour . - Well ? The baroness 's husband is Minister of Propaganda , he can cancel his tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewards do n't behave , they have a cosy brick wall to run up against . B-But tell me about the English travellers , they denied seeing her . Just British diplomacy , never climb a fence if you can sit on it . I ca n't understand why anyone would want to dispose of the old lady . That 's what stumps us but she was on this train and now she 's ... gone . Well ... if you 're right then the whole train is against us . What are we going to do ? In view of what you just told me , I-I shall risk examining the patient . - Come on ... - One moment . We must n't act suspicious , behave as is if nothing had happened . A drink , that 'll steady your nerve . To our health . And may our enemies , if they exist , be unconscious of our purpose . Let 's go , we must hurry now . Come on , drink up . Wait in here . Go on . - Anything wrong ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels . However , it makes no difference . We shall reach Morshkan in three minutes . Quite an eventful journey . Well ? Yes , the patient is Miss Froy . She will be taken off the train at Morshkan . She will be removed to the hospital and operated on . Unfortunately , the operation will not be successful . Oh , I should perhaps have explained . The operation will be performed ... by me . You see , I am in this conspiracy , as you term it . You are a very alert young couple but it 's quite useless to think of a way out of your dilemma . The drinks you had just now . I regret to say contained a quantity of hydrocin . FYI , It is a little-known drug which has the effect , in a small quantity , of paralysing the brain and rendering the victim unconscious for considerable period . In a slightly larger quantity , of course , it induces madness . However , you have my word the dose was a normal one . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say how sorry I am having to take such a ... How shall I say ? Melodramatic course . But your persistent meddling made it necessary . - Are you all right ? You fainted . - Did I ? Listen ! There is a woman next door is going to be murdered and we 've got to go before this stuff takes effect . I read that if you keep going , you can stay awake . Right . Let 's get going . It 's locked . We ca n't go that way , we 'll be spotted . - You ca n't do that ! - Do n't worry , it 's only next door . You stand on your head , touch ur toes , anything , only , whatever you do , do n't fall asleep . Go on , you need n't be afraid , it is Miss Froy . You have n't been drugged . He told me to put something in your drink but I did n't . Who the devil are you ? He said you are deaf dumb Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've got to hurry . Hartz will be back in a min , what will happen then ? If we can hold him off till get past Morshkan , the frontier 's a few miles beyond the station . Come on , there 's still time . - 500 solamente ? Dopo tutto quello che ho fatto ? Cosa poi di questo orecchio mozzicato da quella ragazza ? That 's Morshkan . Have you finished ? Come on , Miss Froy . Cut it out , you 're not drugged . I 'll explain later . Abracadabra . Miss Froy ! Oh , I ca n't believe it ! - Thank you , my dear . Thank you . - Careful . - Ready ? - Yes . Are you all right miss Froy ? Yes . thankyou It 's like rush hour on the underground . Careful , it 's slowing down . Drat . I 'm sorry you 've had such an uncomfortable journey , Miss Froy . Get back on the train . I hope nothing goes wrong . Are n't we stopping rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be off soon . In a few minutes we 'll be over the border . No , I 've been well-paid but this was murder and she was an English woman . - You are Bandrikan ? - My husband was . I 'm English . You were going to butcher her in cold blood Your little diversion made it necessary not only to remove the lady but two others as well . You ca n't do that . Also , it would be unwise of us to permit the existence of anyone who can not be trusted . - You would n't dare . I know too much . - Precisely . I think we 're over the border now . - You can come out , Miss Froy . - Oh , bless me . What an unpleasant journey . Never mind . You shall have a corner seat for the rest of the way .
